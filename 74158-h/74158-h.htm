  THE ADVENTURER<br>
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
CAPTAIN HEMMING FACES A CHANGE OF LIFE
</h3>

<p>
The colonel sat in Captain Hemming's room.
He looked about at the snug furnishings, and the
photographs above the chimney.  Even the row of
polished spurs on their rack against the wall, and
the line of well-shone boots and shoes at the head
of the bed, could not do away with the homelike
air of the room.
</p>

<p>
"Even in Dublin, a man with something over
his pay can make himself comfortable, in seven
months," mused the colonel.  Being a bachelor
himself, he liked the way things were arranged.  For
instance, the small book-shelf above the bed, with
its freight of well-thumbed volumes, tobacco-jar,
and match-box, appealed to him.  He selected a
cigarette from an open box at his elbow, and,
lighting it, sighed contentedly.  In reaching back to
deposit the burnt match on an ash-tray, his hand
upset a stack of folded papers and spilled them on
the floor.
</p>

<p>
"The devil!" he exclaimed, and, doubling up,
scooped for the nearest.
</p>

<p>
What's this, he wondered, as a yard or two
of narrow, printed matter unrolled from his hand.
He was a stranger to galley-proofs.  He looked at
the top of the upper strip, and saw, in heavy, black
type, "The Colonel and the Lady."  Then he settled
back in the chair, crossed his thin, tight-clad legs,
and smoothed the proof.  Ten minutes later
Hemming's orderly entered and mended the fire; but the
colonel did not look up.  The orderly retired.  The
clock on the chimneypiece ticked away the seconds
all unheeded.  The shadows lengthened at the
windows, and at last the colonel straightened himself,
and replaced the papers.  He smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Sly old Hemming," he remarked, and laughed
outright.  "He shouldn't show us up like that,"
he said, "but it's a good yarn.  Wonder if he will
lend it to me to finish to-night?"
</p>

<p>
Just then Captain Hemming entered.
</p>

<p>
By this time the room was dusk with the
twilight of early spring.  He did not sight the colonel
immediately, and, going over to a wardrobe, hung
up his cap and greatcoat.  He was in "undress"
uniform&mdash;his blue serge tunic somewhat shabby,
but his riding-breeches and high, spurred boots
smart and new.  The colonel coughed.
</p>

<p>
Though the captain's greeting was prompt and
polite, it did not hide his surprise.
</p>

<p>
"I dropped in to speak about Tomilson&mdash;he
seems in a bad way," the other explained.  Tomilson
was a full private&mdash;in both rank and condition.
</p>

<p>
Hemming advised leniency in this case.  He had
a soft heart for the men, in spite of his abrupt
diction, and the uncompromising glare of his single
eye-glass.  When the commanding officer was about
to take his departure, the captain asked him to wait
a minute.  His manner was as cool as ever.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p15"></a>
"I intend resigning my commission, sir.  I
decided on the course some days ago, and meant to
speak to you after parade to-morrow," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Bless me," exclaimed the colonel, "what the
devil have you been up to?"
</p>

<p>
The other smiled,&mdash;a somewhat thin smile,&mdash;and
replied that he had not disgraced the regiment,
or done anything low.  "But I'm down to my
pay again," he exclaimed, "and I can't live on
that."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  Have you ever tried?" inquired the
colonel.
</p>

<p>
Hemming did not answer the question, but waited,
with his hands behind his back, and his face toward
the fast darkening windows.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry for it," said the older man, at last.
"You are a good officer,&mdash;forgive my saying
so,&mdash;and&mdash;and the mess swears by you.  I hope you
have suffered no serious misfortune."
</p>

<p>
The captain laughed wanly.
</p>

<p>
"It seems rather serious to me," he replied.  "I've
come to the end of my little pile."
</p>

<p>
"The second, I believe," remarked the colonel.
</p>

<p>
Hemming nodded.
</p>

<p>
"It beats me," exclaimed his superior, and looked
as if an explanation would be welcome.
</p>

<p>
"You would understand, sir, if you were as
big a fool as I have been.  Good nature, without
common business sense to guide it, gets away with
more money than viciousness."
</p>

<p>
He stared gravely at the reclining colonel.  "At
last I have learned my lesson," he concluded, "and
it is this&mdash;put not your trust in cads."
</p>

<p>
The colonel laughed uneasily, and quitted the
room without asking for the loan of the proof-sheets.
Hemming sat down in the vacated chair.
His face now wore a pleasanter expression.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God, I'm not afraid of work," he said,
"but may the devil fly away with that cad
Penthouse.  How can a blood-relation of Molly's
be such a sneaking, mealy-mouthed little cur?  Now,
while I am lying here winged, thanks to my childish
generosity and his beastliness, he is skipping around
in London, on two months' leave.  Herbert Hemming
is done with the ways of lambs and idiots."  Jumping
to his feet, he went to the door and shouted
for his man.  A few minutes later, with the candles
glowing softly on sword and photograph, spur and
book-back, he dressed for dinner.
</p>

<p>
That night the mess found him more talkative
than usual.  But he left early, for his own quarters.
The groups in the anteroom thinned gradually, as
the men went about their various concerns, some
to their rooms, and some to the town, and one across
the square to the colonel's quarters, where the
colonel's youngest sister awaited him.  This sister was
a thorn in the colonel's flesh.  She would not let
him smoke his pipe in the drawing-room (though
he was sure she smoked cigarettes there), and he
heartily hoped his junior major would marry her.
The junior major hoped so too, and, with this hope
in his breast, took his departure, leaving Spalding,
a subaltern, and Major O'Grady alone by the piano.
</p>

<p>
O'Grady balanced his smouldering cigarette on
the edge of the music-stand, and strummed a few
erratic bars.
</p>

<p>
"The other chaps must have suspected something,"
said Spalding.  "I wondered why they all
cleared out."
</p>

<p>
"What are ye doing here, ye impudent young
divil?  Should think ye'd skeedaddle down-town,
now that Penthouse is in London, and ye've got a
chance with the lady," cried the stout Irish major.
The subaltern's boyish face took on an ugly
expression.
</p>

<p>
"Penthouse&mdash;that bounder," he sneered.
</p>

<p>
"I must admit that his manners are a trifle airy,"
returned O'Grady, "but the same can be truly said
of most subs of this glorious age."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not objecting to his manners, major, and
I'm not defending my own," said Spalding.  "I'm
simply naming him a bounder."
</p>

<p>
O'Grady took up his cigarette, and turned his
back on the keyboard.
</p>

<p>
"What are ye kicking about?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Well," replied Spalding, anxiously examining
the ceiling, "I happen to know things about him."
</p>

<p>
"Ye're a gossip, me boy, that's what ye are," cried
the major, "and of all contemptible things, the
worst is a male gossip.  What do ye happen to know
about him, me boy?"
</p>

<p>
A faint smile played across the lieutenant's
upturned face; but the impatient major did not notice
it.
</p>

<p>
"To begin with, he's some sort of cousin to a
Miss Travers, an English girl whom Hemming is in
love with," said Spalding.
</p>

<p>
"Then you object to him on purely social
grounds," interrupted the Irishman.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, shut up, and let me tell my tale.  Social
grounds be shot&mdash;Miss Travers is daughter of a
lord bish-hop.  Penthouse is son of a baronet.  What
I'm getting at is that good old Hemming, just
because this chap is related to his girl, has looked
after him like a dry-nurse for more than a year.
That is right enough.  But&mdash;and this is not known
by any one but me&mdash;Hemming backed a lot of
his paper, and for the last two months he has been
paying the piper.  Once upon a time, in the memory
of man, Hemming had some money, but I'll eat
my helmet if he has any now."
</p>

<p>
"How d'ye know all this?" asked O'Grady, letting
his fat cigarette smoulder its life away
unheeded.  Spalding touched his eyes lightly with his
finger-tips.
</p>

<p>
"Saw," he said.
</p>

<p>
The major gave vent to his feelings in muttered
oaths, all the while keeping an observant eye upon
his companion.
</p>

<p>
"I'll wager now that Hemming has some good
old Irish blood in him," he remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you think that?" asked Spalding,
deliberately yawning.
</p>

<p>
"His generosity leads me to think so.  There are
other officers of infantry regiments who'd be better
off to-day, but for their kind hearts and Irish blood."  The
major sighed windily as he made this statement.
</p>

<p>
"Methinks you mean Irish whiskey," retorted
Spalding.  With dignity O'Grady arose from the
piano-stool.
</p>

<p>
"I'll not listen to any more of your low gossip,"
he said, and started for the door, in a hurry to
carry the news to any one he might find at home.
</p>

<p>
"You needn't mention my name, sir," called
Spalding, over his shoulder.  His superior officer
left the room without deigning a reply.

CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
HEMMING MEETS WITH A STRANGE RECEPTION
</h3>

<p>
Herbert Hemming sat alone in his room, while
his brother officers sought their pleasure in divers
companies.  His writing-table was drawn close to
the fire.  His scarlet mess-jacket made a vivid spot
of colour, in the softly illuminated room.  He was
busily occupied with the proofs of "The Colonel
and the Lady," when his man rapped at the door
and entered.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing more," said the captain, without looking
up.  The soldier saluted, but did not go.  Presently
his master's attention was awakened by the
uneasy creaking of his boots.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you want?"
</p>

<p>
"Me mother is very ill, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not a doctor, Malloy."
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't thinkin' of insultin' you, sir."
</p>

<p>
Hemming sighed, and laid down his pen.
</p>

<p>
"I have found you a satisfactory servant," he
said, "also a frightful liar."
</p>

<p>
"I must confess to you, sir," replied the man,
"that I was lyin' last month about me father,&mdash;he's
been dead as St. Pathrick this seven year,&mdash;but
to-night I'm tellin' you the truth, sir, so help
me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind that," interrupted Hemming.
</p>

<p>
Malloy was silent.
</p>

<p>
"So your mother is very ill?" continued the
captain.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir,&mdash;locomotive attacks, sir."
</p>

<p>
"And poor, I take it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir,&mdash;four bob a week."
</p>

<p>
Hemming felt in his pockets and drew out a
sovereign.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry it's so little," he said, "but if you give
me her address to-morrow I'll call and see her."
</p>

<p>
"God bless you, sir," said the man.  He took
the money, and hesitated beside the table.
</p>

<p>
Hemming glanced at him inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"Beggin' your pardon, sir, it beats me how you
knows when I'm lyin' and when I'm tellin' the
truth," exclaimed the orderly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm learning things by experience.  Good night,
Malloy."
</p>

<p>
Alone again, Hemming made short work of his
proofs.  After sealing them into a yellow envelope,
and inscribing thereon the address of a big New
York weekly (whose editor had proved partial to
his sketches and stories of "doings" in the Imperial
Army), he produced some of the regimental
stationery and began a letter to Miss Travers.  It was
no easy undertaking&mdash;the writing of this particular
letter.  After struggling for some minutes with
the first sentence, he leaned back in his chair and fell
into retrospection.  His age was now twenty-nine
years.  He had done with Sandhurst at twenty-one,
and had been in the army ever since; had seen
more than his share of foreign service, and two
seasons of border-scrapping in Northern India.  He
had gone ahead in his chosen profession, despite a
weakness for reading poetry in bed and writing
articles descriptive of people and things he knew.
During his father's lifetime his allowance (though
he was but a third son) was ample, and even enabled
him to play polo, and shortly after his father's death
an almost unknown great-aunt had left him a modest
little sum&mdash;not much of a fortune, but a very
comfortable possession.  Two years previous to his
present troubles he had fallen in love.  So had the
girl.  A year ago he had proposed and been
accepted.  He had, for her sake, fathered a reckless,
impecunious subaltern, by name Penthouse, lending
him money and endorsing his notes, and now
he was stripped bare to his pay.  If he had never
met the girl, things would not look so bad, for
certain papers and magazines had begun to buy
his stories.  By sitting up to it and working hard,
he felt that he could make more as a writer than
as a soldier.  But the idea of giving up the girl
sent a sickening chill through his heart.  Surely she
would understand, and cheer him up the new path.
But it was with a heavy heart that he returned to
the writing of the letter.  Slowly, doggedly he went
through with it, telling of his loss of fortune,
through helping a person whom he would not name,
and of his hopes and plans for the future.  He told
of the adventurous position he had accepted, but
the day before, with an American Newspaper
Syndicate&mdash;a billet that would necessitate his almost
immediate departure for Greece.  The pain of his
disappointment crept, all unnoticed by him, into the
style of his writing, and made the whole letter sound
strained and unnatural.
</p>

<p>
By the time the letter was sealed and ready for
the mail, Hemming was tired out.  He flung
himself on the bed, unhooked the collar of his
mess-jacket (they hooked at the collar a few years ago),
and, lighting his pipe, lay for some time in unhappy
half-dreaming.  He knew, for, at the last, young
Penthouse had not been careful to hide his cloven
foot, that he might just as well expect another
great-aunt to leave him another lump of money as to look
for any reimbursement from the source of his
misfortune.  The fellow was bad, he mused, but just
how bad his friends and the world must find out
for themselves.  Of course he would give Molly a
hint to that effect, when he saw her.  He had not
done so in the letter, because it had been hard enough
to write, without that.
</p>

<p>
Hemming went on duty next day, wearing, to the
little world of the regiment, his usual alert and
undisturbed expression.  Shortly before noon he wrote
and forwarded a formal resignation of his commission.
By dinner-time the word that he had given
up the service had reached every member of the
mess.  Spalding's story had also made the rounds,
in one form or another (thanks to Major O'Grady,
that righteous enemy to gossip), and the colonel
alone was ignorant of it.  During dinner little was
said about Hemming's sudden move.  All felt it
more or less keenly; the colonel grieved over the
loss of so capable an officer, and the others lamented
the fact that a friend and a gentleman was forced
to leave their mess because one cad happened to be
a member of it.  Hemming felt their quiet sympathy.
Even the waiters tending him displayed an increased
solicitousness.
</p>

<p>
Hemming remained in Dublin a week after
resigning his commission.  He had a good deal of
business to attend to, and some important letters
to receive&mdash;one from the American Syndicate,
containing a check, and at least two from Miss Travers.
It had been the lady's custom, ever since their
engagement, to write him twice a week.  Three were
now overdue.  The American letter came, with its
terse and satisfactory typewritten instructions and
narrow slip of perforated paper, but the English
missive failed to put in an appearance.  He tried not
to worry during the day, and, being busy, succeeded
fairly well, but at night, being defenceless, care
visited him even in his dreams.  Sometimes he saw
the woman he loved lying ill&mdash;too ill to hold a pen.
Sometimes he saw her with a new unsuspected look
in her eyes, turning an indifferent face upon his
supplications.  He lost weight in those few days, and
Spalding (who, with the others, thought his only
trouble the loss of his money) said that but for the
work he had in getting a fair price for his pony, his
high-cart, and his extra pairs of riding-boots, he
would have blown his brains out.
</p>

<p>
On his last night in Dublin his old regiment gave
a dinner in his honour.  Civilians were there, and
officers from every branch of the service, and when
Major O'Grady beheld Hemming (which did not
happen until late in the dinner), clothed in the
unaccustomed black and white, with his medal with
two clasps pinned on his coat, he tried to sing
something about an Irish gentleman, and burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
"There's not a drop of the craychure in his
blood," said Spalding, across the table.
</p>

<p>
"But he's the boy with the warm heart," whimpered
the major.
</p>

<p>
"And the open hand," said the subaltern.
</p>

<p>
"The same has been the ruin of many of us,"
replied O'Grady.
</p>

<p>
It was well for Lieutenant Penthouse that he did
not return to Dublin in time to attend that dinner.
</p>

<p>
Hemming knew a score of private houses in
London where he would be welcome for a night
or a month, but in his bitter mood he ignored the
rights of friendship and went to a small hotel in
an unfashionable part of the town.  As soon as he
had changed from his rough tweeds into more suitable
attire, he started, in a cab, for the Travers
house.  The bishop was dead, and the widow,
preferring London to Norfolk, spent every season in
town.  Hemming was sure of finding some one
at home, though he trembled at the memory of his
evil dreams.  Upon reaching the house he dismissed
the cab.  The maid who opened the door recognized
him, and showed him into the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
"I hope every one is well," he said, pausing on
the threshold.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," replied the maid, looking surprised
at the question.  She had seen Captain Hemming
many times, but never before had he addressed her.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Hemming that he waited hours in
the narrow, heavily furnished room.  He could not
sit still.  At last he got to his feet, and, crossing to
a corner table, examined the photographs of some
people he knew.  He wondered where his had gone
to&mdash;the full-length portrait by Bettel, in
field-uniform.  He looked for it everywhere, an
uncomfortable curiosity pricking him.  Turning from his
search, he saw Miss Travers watching him.  He
took a step toward her, and stopped short.  Her face
was white, her eyes were dark with the shadow of
pain.  Something had put out the familiar
illumination that love had lighted so gloriously.
</p>

<p>
"Molly," whispered the man.  His hands, extended
at first sight of her, dropped impotently at
his side.  "For God's sake, what is the matter?"
he cried.  His honest gray eyes asked the question
as plainly.  Hers wavered, and looked beyond him
in a pitiful, strained gaze.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you ask?  You surely know," she said.
</p>

<p>
He could not speak for a moment.  His brain, in
a whirl of apprehension, groped for some clue
whereby it might find understanding.
</p>

<p>
"I know nothing," he said, at last, "save that I
am horribly afraid of something I do not
understand&mdash;of your silence and the change in you."  He
paused for a moment, scanning her averted face.
"And now I am a poor man," he added.
</p>

<p>
At that a faint red stole into her cheeks.  He
drew nearer and laid a hand quickly and tenderly
upon her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Dear girl, can that weigh against me?" he
asked, scarce above his breath.  She moved from his
touch with a gesture that sent the blood ringing back
to brain and heart.  The madness of the righteous
anger ebbed, leaving him cool and observant.
</p>

<p>
"I must beg your pardon for intruding, and now
I shall go," he said.  "It was well worth the loss
of a few thousands of pounds&mdash;to find the real
nature of your love."
</p>

<p>
He passed her with squared shoulders and sneering
lip, and strode briskly toward the door.
</p>

<p>
"Wait," she cried, "I do not understand you."  Her
voice contained a new note.
</p>

<p>
He turned on the threshold and bowed.
</p>

<p>
"You have known me long enough," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she replied.  He stood in the doorway and
stared at her.
</p>

<p>
"If I am dreaming, then wake me, dear.  Surely
you love me?"
</p>

<p>
His voice was tense.  He moved as if to approach
her again.
</p>

<p>
"I have learned of your other life&mdash;of your
living lie," she cried, weakly.
</p>

<p>
"My other life," he repeated, smiling gently.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said, "from my cousin.  It was his
duty.  Tell me it is not true."
</p>

<p>
He saw the tears in her eyes.  He marked the
supplication in her voice.  But he did not move
from the threshold.
</p>

<p>
"From Penthouse?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
She did not answer him.  She stood with one
hand raised to her breast, and a world of entreaty
in her gaze.
</p>

<p>
"I thought," said Hemming, coldly, "that you
loved me.  I thought that when a woman loved the
man who loves her, that she also trusted him.  But
I am very ignorant, considering my age."
</p>

<p>
He took his hat and stick from the rack in the
hall, and let himself out of the front door.  He
stood for a few seconds on the steps and looked up
and down the street.  A cab rolled up to the curb.
After drawing on his gloves and adjusting his
monocle, he stepped into the cab and quietly gave
the name of his club to the man behind.
</p>

<p>
The cab bowled along the quiet, respectable street.
</p>

<p>
"Stop here," cried Hemming, when they had
reached the corner, and as the horse slid to a standstill
he stepped out, and went up to a heavily dressed
young man on the pavement.  The stranger did not
see him, and held on in the direction from which
Hemming had just come.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me&mdash;a word," said Hemming.
</p>

<p>
The other halted.  His heavy, handsome face
whitened under its unhealthy skin.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, how do, Hemming," he said.
</p>

<p>
Hemming took the extended hand.  They stood
about the same height.  Hemming retained his grip
of the other's hand.
</p>

<p>
"I am somewhat pressed for time," he said, "so
you'll forgive me if I begin immediately."
</p>

<p>
He jerked Mr. Penthouse toward him with a
downward wrench of his right arm, and, with his
stick in his left hand, he administered a short and
severe caning.
</p>

<p>
"I'm a-waitin' for you, guvnor," called the cabby.
</p>

<p>
Leaving Mr. Penthouse seated upon the pavement,
dazed and blasphemous, Hemming returned
to the cab and drove away.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
HEMMING VISITS THE MANAGER OF THE SYNDICATE
</h3>

<p>
Hemming's club was a favourite resort of military
and naval men stationed near town, or home on
leave.  He met half a dozen whom he knew more
or less intimately.  All had something to say about
his change of career, but presently he escaped them,
and sought a quiet corner of the reading-room,
where he could smoke and stare at the latest papers.
Reading was out of the question.  He might as well
have tried to sing.  Several times he was ready to
leave the club and return to Miss Travers, but the
memory of the movement she had made when he
had touched her shoulder kept him crushed in his
chair.  He dined at the club, and drank more than
was his custom.  The sound wine brought colour
back to his cheeks.
</p>

<p>
A youngster, who had been stationed in Halifax,
Nova Scotia, for a year past, came over to his
table with an American magazine in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, old chap, your stories are quite
the rage in Halifax," he said.  "I notice, though,
that the fellows here do not know what you are
up to at all.  One soon leaves the trick of reading
the magazines on the other side."
</p>

<p>
This unexpected word for his literary work
cheered Hemming considerably.  He invited the
youth to seat himself and have a cigar.  Soon he
found himself telling his admirer something of his
aspirations.
</p>

<p>
When Anderson of the Royal Engineers came
in, he found Hemming and the lieutenant on leave
from Canada still talking across the table.
Anderson was Hemming's senior by some four or five
years, but they had been friends since childhood.
After their greeting, Anderson said:
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen Penthouse?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I met him about five o'clock," replied
Hemming.
</p>

<p>
Anderson's face brightened, and he slapped his
knee with his broad hand.
</p>

<p>
"I ran across him in an apothecary's shop a few
hours ago, and, as I had just heard of your arrival,
I wondered if you had met him," he said.  "You
see," he continued, "I have had my eye on him of
late.  The Travers and I are still very good friends,
you know."
</p>

<p>
"This sounds very interesting," broke in the
lieutenant.  "What is it all about?"
</p>

<p>
"I hardly know myself," answered Hemming.
</p>

<p>
The lieutenant wished them good night, shook
hands cordially with both, and, after assuring
Hemming that he would watch eagerly for everything
he wrote, left the dining-room.
</p>

<p>
"Williams seems a good sort," remarked Hemming.
</p>

<p>
Anderson did not answer.  He looked as if he
were thinking unusually hard.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you'll be in town for a while," he
said.
</p>

<p>
"I leave to-morrow for Greece.  I'm a newspaper
correspondent now," replied Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"You must stay a few days," said the engineer.
"A few days will do it.  You have no right to
fly off the handle like that."
</p>

<p>
"Like what?" asked the other.
</p>

<p>
"My dear boy, I have known for a week just
how it would be, and now I am in rather a hole
myself," said Anderson.
</p>

<p>
"Have you been living a double life?" inquired
Hemming, with a sneer.
</p>

<p>
"Great heavens!" exclaimed the lusty sapper,
"do you mean to say?&mdash;but no, I only told the lady
that Penthouse was a rotten little liar.  Strong
language, I must admit."
</p>

<p>
Hemming laughed shortly.
</p>

<p>
"You must not trouble yourself too much, Dicky,
for it's really not worth while," he said.
</p>

<p>
A little later Hemming excused himself to his
friend on the plea that he had to return to his
hotel, and write some letters.
</p>

<p>
"I am my own master no longer," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I think you are just beginning," replied Anderson,
drily.
</p>

<p>
Hemming looked into the future, saw his body
journeying, vagrant as the wind, and his hand at a
hundred adventures, but never an hour of freedom.
He went down the wide steps and into the street
with hell and longing in his heart.
</p>

<p>
Hemming spent two weeks in Greece.  He wrote
a few descriptive stories for his syndicate, and then
crossed into Turkey, where he was offered a
commission.  He wired that fighting was certain.  The
syndicate thought otherwise, and called him across
the world to see or make trouble in South America.
He cursed their stupidity and started, spending only
a few hours in England, and taking ship in Liverpool
for New York.  Arriving in that city, he and
his possessions (and he carried a full outfit)
journeyed in a cab to an old and respectable hotel on
Broadway.  The fare he had to pay opened his
eyes.  But what could he do beyond staring the
cabby out of countenance with his baleful, glaring
eye-glass?  At the hotel, they were kind enough
to take him for a duke in disguise.  Next morning
he found his way to the offices of the New York
News Syndicate, in a high gray building on Fulton
Street.  He scrambled into one of the great caged
elevators, close on the heels of a stout gentleman
in a yellow spring overcoat and silk hat.  The lift
was lighted by several small electric bulbs.  The
air was warm, and heavy with the scent of stale
cigarette smoke.
</p>

<p>
"New York News Syndicate," said Hemming
to the attendant.
</p>

<p>
"Third floor," said the man, and up they shot
and stopped.  The iron grating was rolled back.
Hemming stepped out into a cool, white-floored
hall, and, turning, found the stout gentleman at
his heels.
</p>

<p>
"I think you are Captain Hemming," said the
stranger, "and I am quite sure I am Benjamin
Dodder."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! the manager of the syndicate," exclaimed
Hemming, waggling Mr. Dodder's extended hand,
and looking keenly into his wide, clean-shaven face.
Dodder was a much younger man than his figure
would lead one to suppose.  Hemming thought his
face far too heavy for his bright, good-natured
brown eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I got in last night, and came 'round for orders,"
explained Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"That was good of you," replied the manager,
looking gratified.  He led the way through several
large rooms, where clerks and stenographers were
hard at work, to his private office.  He paused at
the door, and turning, said to a clerk with a glaring
red necktie and beautifully parted hair: "Ask
Mr. Wells to step into my room when he comes.  Tell
him Captain Herbert Hemming has arrived."  A
dozen keen, inquiring faces were lifted from desk
and machine, and turned toward the new correspondent.
</p>

<p>
Within the manager's office were expensively
upholstered chairs, leather-topped tables, polished
bookcases, and half a dozen admirably chosen
engravings, and above the grate many photographs,
with signatures scrawled across them.  The carpet
underfoot was soft and thick.
</p>

<p>
"Try this chair, sir," invited Mr. Dodder.
</p>

<p>
Hemming sank into it, and balanced his hat and
stick on his knees; Mr. Dodder snatched them from
him and placed them on his table.  Then he pulled
off his coat and expanded his chest.
</p>

<p>
"Now I begin to feel like working," he remarked,
with youthful gusto.
</p>

<p>
"What an extraordinary chap," thought Hemming.
</p>

<p>
Dodder opened a drawer in his table, and took
out a box of cigars.  Hemming recognized the label,
and remembered that they cost, in London, three
shillings apiece by the hundred.
</p>

<p>
"Have a smoke.  They're not half bad," said the
manager, extending the box.
</p>

<p>
The Englishman lit a weed, and felt that it was
time to begin business.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you recall me from Greece?" he
asked.  "They are sure to stand up to Turkey,
unless all signs fail."
</p>

<p>
This straightforward question seemed to catch
the manager unawares.  He rolled his cigar about
between his white fingers, and crossed and uncrossed
his legs several times before he answered.
</p>

<p>
"It's this way," he began, and paused to glance
at the closed door.  From the door his eyes turned
to Hemming.  "We believe as you do," he said,
"but another man wanted the job.  He left here
three days ago."
</p>

<p>
As Hemming had nothing to say to that, Dodder
continued: "The other chap has been with us five
or six years, and, though he is a good writer, he
knows nothing of war.  You were my choice, but
Devlin happens to be Wells's brother-in-law.  I
was up against it all right, so I slid off as easy as
I could."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you all the same," said Hemming.
"Now tell me what you want done in South
America."
</p>

<p>
"We want you to start in Yucatan," replied
Dodder, "or somewhere along there, and travel,
with a nigger or two, to any part of the country
that promises copy.  If you hear of a revolution
anywhere, go hunt it out.  Use the wire when you
have news, but for the rest of it write good, full
stories in your usual style.  Why, captain, have
you any idea how many newspapers, in this country
and Canada, printed each of those stories of
yours from Greece and Turkey?"
</p>

<p>
Hemming shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-six, no less," said the manager.  "I
believe you would prove a paying investment if
we marooned you on Anticosti," he added.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you like my stuff," answered Hemming,
"and as for Anticosti, why, I believe one
could make some interesting copy there."
</p>

<p>
"You must try it one of these days," said Dodder.
</p>

<p>
At that moment, a thin, undersized man entered
the room, without the formality of knocking.  He
walked with a slight limp in his left foot.  Dodder
introduced him to Hemming as Mr. Wells, the
syndicate's treasurer, and a partner in the concern.
Wells gave the correspondent a nerveless handshake.
</p>

<p>
"Glad to meet you," he said, and turned to the
manager with an air of inquiry.
</p>

<p>
It was clear to the Englishman that Dodder was
not thoroughly at ease in his partner's company.
He returned to his cigar and his seat with a
suggestion of "by your leave" in his air.
</p>

<p>
"I think we shall let Captain Hemming start
south as soon as he likes," he said.
</p>

<p>
"It's a pleasure trip, is it?" remarked Wells, with
his hands in his pockets, and a casual eye on the
Englishman.
</p>

<p>
Hemming stared, his cigar half-raised to his lips.
Dodder flushed.
</p>

<p>
"Then Captain Hemming shall start day after
to-morrow," he said, in a soothing voice.  Wells
paid no attention to this remark.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to send in more copy.  You might
let us have extra stories from each place, under
another name.  We could use them," he said to
Hemming.  The monocle held him in its unwinking
regard for several seconds.  Then the Englishman
spoke:
</p>

<p>
"I wish you to understand me from the start,"
he said.  "When I was in the service of my country,
I was perfectly willing to do one man's work,
or three men's work, for the pay that I got, because
it was a matter of sentiment with me, and because
I could afford to do it.  But now, if I do two men's
work, as you suggest, I draw double pay.  Another
thing, I shall take my orders from one man, or I
shall take no orders at all.  Mr. Dodder is my man
for choice."
</p>

<p>
It was evident that this speech of the new
correspondent's threw Dodder into a flurry, and left
Wells aghast.  Hemming sat in his comfortable
chair, and calmly smoked his excellent cigar.  At
last Wells found his voice.
</p>

<p>
"I think the less I have to do with this man,
the better," he said, and left the room.  When the
door shut behind him, Dodder sighed with relief.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God that's over," he said, and
immediately expanded to his former genial self.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter with him?" asked Hemming, mildly.
</p>

<p>
"Guess he was born that way," replied the manager,
"and he really doesn't know what an impression
he gives.  He has a great head for business."
</p>

<p>
"I should judge so," said Hemming.
</p>

<p>
Dodder laughed.  "Now pull up your chair and
we'll make your plans," he said, straightening his
bulky legs under the table.  They worked busily
with maps and note-books for over an hour.  At
the end of that time a clerk entered with a bunch of
letters and manuscripts.  One of the letters was for
Hemming.  It had been readdressed and forwarded
half a dozen times; and after all it proved to be
nothing more important than a meandering scrawl
from Major O'Grady.  "We keep your memory
green, dear boy," wrote the major, and much more
in the same vein.  But a crooked postscript proved
of interest.  It said that Penthouse was back in
Dublin, and was going to the bow-wows at a fearful pace.
</p>

<p>
Hemming completed his arrangements with the
syndicate, and, returning to his hotel, lunched
solidly on underdone steak, French fried potatoes, a
bottle of ale, a jam tart, and coffee.  Love might
display clay feet.  Wells might be as rude as the
devil, and Penthouse might go to the devil, but
Herbert Hemming did not intend setting forth on
his affairs with an empty stomach.  The world was a
rotten enough place without that.  He consumed
three cigarettes over his coffee, in a leisurely
manner, and by the time he had left his table by the
window the great dining-room was empty.  He
spent the rest of the day wandering about the city,
conquering a desire to write to Miss Travers.  He
dined at an Italian restaurant, and went early to
bed.  By nine next morning, he and his traps were
aboard a little south-bound steamer.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
THE ADVENT OF MR. O'ROURKE AND HIS SERVANT
</h3>

<p>
The company of the <i>Laura</i> was small and
undistinguished.  The captain was a Nova Scotian, big
and red, who had, once upon a time, skippered a
full-rigged ship, and who still sighed at the memory
of it as he looked along the narrow, dirty decks of
his present craft.  The mate was a New Yorker,
with a master's certificate and a head full of stories
of the prowess of the American Navy.  The chief
engineer had once been a good man in his profession,
but the whiskey of his mother country had
surely and slowly brought him down to his present
berth.  The half-dozen passengers were of little
interest to Hemming, and the days dragged for him,
sickening with memories.  In self-defence he
reverted to fiction, and even attempted verse.
</p>

<p>
One morning, in the Gulf of Mexico, the <i>Laura</i>
was signalled by an open boat with a rubber blanket
for sail.  The engines slowed.  Hemming was on
the bridge at the time, and turned the captain's
glass upon the little craft.
</p>

<p>
"What do you make of it, sir?" inquired the
skipper, from the door of the tiny chart-room below.
</p>

<p>
"She looks like a ship's boat," replied Hemming.
"The sail is rigged square, with a boat-hook and
an oar for yards, and has a hole in the middle; it's
a poncho, I think.  There's a nigger forward,
waving a shirt, and a white man aft, smoking."
</p>

<p>
The captain hurried up to the bridge and took the
glass.  After aiming it at the bobbing stranger, he
turned to Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"My boat," he said, "and the same damn fool
aboard her."
</p>

<p>
"Your boat?" inquired Hemming.
</p>

<p>
The mariner glared, with angry eyes, across the
glinting water.  Suddenly his face cleared.  "I
win," he cried.  "I bet him ten dollars he'd have
to get out inside six weeks, and by cracky, so he
has!"
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?" asked the Englishman.
</p>

<p>
"He's Mr. O'Rourke, the man who's lookin' for
trouble," replied the big Nova Scotian.
</p>

<p>
"What's he doing with your boat, and why didn't
he take a decent sail while he was about it?"
Hemming asked.
</p>

<p>
"He had a decent enough sail when I saw him
last," explained the skipper, "and I don't mean
to say that he's a thief.  He paid for the boat, right
enough, though he bargained pretty close.  He
wanted to see more of Cuba, you know, but the
Spaniards wouldn't have anything more to do with
him, because of something he wrote, so he just got
me to steam in five weeks ago, and let him off in
the port life-boat.  Now he's back again, with a
nigger."
</p>

<p>
"What's his game?" asked Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Search me,&mdash;unless it's just trouble," said the
mariner, returning the glass and hurrying down
to the deck.
</p>

<p>
By this time the <i>Laura</i> was rolling lazily.  The
captain ordered a man to stand ready with a line;
the poncho was lowered, aboard the adventurous
rowboat, and the nigger manned the oars; the
white man in the stern sheets stood up and raised
his Panama hat, and the passengers along the
<i>Laura's</i> rail replied with cheers.  The captain leaned
far over the side.  "What about that bet?" he
shouted.  The stranger drew his hand from a pocket
of his ragged ducks and held something
aloft,&mdash;something crumpled and green.  Then he regained
his soaring seat, and gripped the tiller.
</p>

<p>
The captain lifted a beaming countenance to
Hemming on the bridge.  "That's the first white man
who ever got out of Cuba with ten dollars," he
bawled.  Evidently the captain did not consider
Spaniards as white men.
</p>

<p>
The line was thrown, and went circling and
unfolding through the air until it fell into the boat.
The ladder was unlashed and dropped over the
<i>Laura's</i> side.  In a minute O'Rourke and the pacifico
were on the deck, and in another minute the
port life-boat was back on its davits.  O'Rourke
was warmly welcomed aboard.  Even the chief
engineer appeared from below to shake his hand.
The captain hurried him to the chart-room, and
beckoned to Hemming from the door.  When Hemming
entered, he found the newcomer lying full
length on the locker, with a glass of whiskey and
water in his left hand, and the other under his
head.  He got stiffly to his feet upon the Englishman's
entrance, and, after shaking hands cordially,
lay down again.
</p>

<p>
"Now what do you think of that?" queried the
skipper, glancing from O'Rourke to the other.
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke laughed good-naturedly, but with a
note of weariness.  "I must confess it was not
exactly a Sunday-school picnic," he said, "and a
chap's insides get fearfully squirmy on a diet of
sugar-cane and a few random plantains."
</p>

<p>
The skipper, who had been carefully, even
lovingly, mixing drinks in two more glasses, eyed
O'Rourke severely.
</p>

<p>
"You'd better get married, and give up them
tomfool actions," he said, "or some fine day the
Spaniards will catch up to you, and then,&mdash;well,
you'll be sorry, that's all."
</p>

<p>
"They caught up to several of our party this
time," remarked O'Rourke, casually.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" exclaimed Hemming, straightening
his eye-glass.
</p>

<p>
The man with the Irish name and non-committal
accent turned his head on the locker, and smiled at
the other adventurer.
</p>

<p>
"They were not particular pals of mine," he
said, reassuringly, "so I didn't stay to inquire their
fate."
</p>

<p>
"You're fool enough to have stayed," remarked
the skipper.
</p>

<p>
Hemming stared at the free and easy language
of the mariner, and at O'Rourke's good-natured
way of taking it, for he had not yet become
entirely accustomed to the ways of the world outside
the army, and this O'Rourke, though unshaven and
in tatters, was certainly a gentleman, by Hemming's
standards.  The master of the <i>Laura</i> may have read
something of this in his passenger's face, for he
turned to him and said: "Mr. O'Rourke and I
are pretty good friends.  We've played ashore
together, and we've sailed together more than once,
and when I call him a fool, why, it's my way of
saying he's the bangest-up, straight-grained man
I know.  I never call him a fool before his inferiors,
and if it came to any one else calling him anything,
why&mdash;" and he slapped his big red hand on the
chart-room table with a blow that rocked the bottles.
</p>

<p>
"Shut up," said O'Rourke, blushing beneath his
bristles and tan, "or Captain Hemming will take me
for as silly an ass as he takes you."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," began Hemming, awkwardly, and,
when the others roared with laughter, he hid his
confusion by draining his glass.  He had never
before been laughed at quite so violently, but he
found, rather to his surprise, that he liked it.
</p>

<p>
After lunch, O'Rourke (whose full name was
Bertram St. Ives O'Rourke) retired to his stateroom,
and did not reappear until dinner-time.  He
looked better then, clean shaven, and attired in one
of the skipper's extra warm-weather suits.  He
filled the borrowed clothes well enough in length
and in breadth of shoulder, but confessed, at table,
that the trousers lapped twice around his waist.
During the simple meal, the conversation was all
of the internal disturbance of Cuba, and all the
passengers, as well as the skipper, seemed interested
in the matter and well informed of recent incidents.
Hemming listened keenly, now and then putting
a question.  O'Rourke told a part of his adventures
during his last stay in the island, and sketched, in
vivid and well-chosen words, the daily life of the
patriots.  It was not as romantic as Hemming had
hoped.
</p>

<p>
"It's a low sort of fighting on both sides,&mdash;not
the kind you have mixed in," said O'Rourke to
Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"I?" exclaimed Hemming, while the dusky
passengers and burly skipper pricked up their ears.
</p>

<p>
"I saw your initials&mdash;H.H.&mdash;on your cigarette
case," he explained, "and I have read some
good things signed H.H., by an Englishman, on
English army life, so of course I spotted you."
</p>

<p>
"I'm doing work for the New York News Syndicate
now," said Hemming.
</p>

<p>
After dinner, O'Rourke led the way to the
chart-room.  From the locker he produced a small
typewriting machine.  This he oiled, and set up on the
table.  The skipper winked at Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I'd smashed the danged thing while he
was away," he said.  O'Rourke paid not the slightest
attention to this pleasantry, but inserted a sheet
of paper, of which he had a supply stored in the
same place of safety.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said he, seating himself on a camp-stool
before the machine, "I don't mind how much you
two talk, but I have some work to do."
</p>

<p>
"You, too?" laughed the Englishman.
</p>

<p>
"I'm only a free-lance," said O'Rourke, and,
lighting a cigarette, he began clicking the keys.
For more than an hour he worked steadily, while
the skipper and Hemming sat side by side on the
locker and told stories.  The door was hooked open,
and a fresh breeze kept the room cool, and circled
the pungent smoke.
</p>

<p>
When Hemming turned in, he found that He
could not sleep.  His brain jumped and kept busy,
in spite of him.  Now he lived again his exciting
days in Northern India.  From this he flashed to
the Norfolk tennis lawn, where Molly Travers
listened again to his ardent vows.  He turned over
and tried to win himself to slumber by counting
imaginary sheep.  But that only seemed to suggest
to his memory the care-free days of his youth.
Again he built forts in the warm earth of the
potting-house.  Again he fled from the red-headed
gardener, and stumbled into piled-up ranks of flowerpots,
hurling them to destruction.  Again he watched
his father, in pink and spurs, trot down the avenue
in the gold, rare sunlight of those days.  Feeling
that these good memories would carry him safely
to the land of peace, he closed his eyes,&mdash;only to
find his mind busy with that last day in London.
He climbed swiftly from his berth, and, after
slipping his feet into his shoes, ascended to the deck.
He did not wait to change his pajamas for anything
more conventional.  There was not a breath of
wind.  The stars burned big and white; the water
over the side flashed away in silver fire, and farther
out some rolling fish broke its trail of flame; to
starboard lay a black suggestion of land.  Looking
forward, he saw that the door of the chart-room
stood open, emitting a warm flood of lamplight.
He went up to the lower bridge, or half-deck, where
the chart-room stood, and glanced within.  The
skipper lay on the locker, snoring peacefully, and
O'Rourke still clicked at the typewriter.  Hemming
stole quietly in and poured himself a glass of water
from the clay bottle on the rack.
</p>

<p>
"Don't let me disturb you," he said to the worker.
"I'll just have a smoke to kill wakefulness."
</p>

<p>
"If you can't sleep," said O'Rourke, "just listen
to this as long as your eyes will stay open."
</p>

<p>
He sorted over his pages of copy and began to
read.  His voice was low-pitched, and through it
sounded the whispering of the steamer's passage
across the rocking waters.  The style was full of
colour, and Hemming was keenly interested from
start to finish.  Not until the last page was turned
over did O'Rourke look up.
</p>

<p>
"What! not asleep yet!" he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"That seems to me very fine," said Hemming,
seriously, "and I should certainly take it for literature
of an unusually high order if I did not know
that journalists cannot write literature."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think it will do?" asked O'Rourke,
modestly.
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap," replied Hemming, "it will do
for anything,&mdash;for a book, or to carve on a monument.
It's a dashed sight too good for any newspaper."
</p>

<p>
"It certainly wouldn't do for a newspaper,"
laughed the younger man.  "Just imagine an editor
with a blue pencil, loose on those descriptions of
vegetation.  When I do newspaper stuff, I throw
in the blood and leave out the beauty.  That is for
<i>Griffin's Magazine</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure of your market?" asked the Englishman,
wondering for even in England, <i>Griffin's</i>
was known for its quality.
</p>

<p>
"It was ordered," said O'Rourke, "and this will
make the ninth article I have done for them within
five years.  After months of seeing and feeling
things, I put the heart of it all, at one sitting, into
a story for <i>Griffin's</i>.  After that I cook my
experiences and hard-earned knowledge into lesser dishes
for lesser customers.  Sometimes I even let it off
in lyrics."
</p>

<p>
"You must flood the magazines," remarked Hemming, dryly.
</p>

<p>
"Not I.  To begin with, I place a great deal of
my work with publications of which you have never
heard, and then, as I am young and very productive,
I write under three names, using my own for only
the things I wish to stand."
</p>

<p>
He arose and turned out the light, and to
Hemming's amazement gray dawn was on the sea and
the narrow decks, and on the morning wind came
the odour of coffee.
</p>

<p>
"I think we are both good for a nap now," said
O'Rourke.  They left the master of the boat
slumbering on his narrow couch, and went to their
staterooms; and before Hemming fell asleep, with his
face to the draft of the port, he thanked God in
his heart for a new friend.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
THE ADVENTURERS DISPENSE WITH MR. NUNEZ
</h3>

<p>
Hemming and O'Rourke, and O'Rourke's low-caste
Cuban, landed in Belize.  The <i>Laura</i> continued
on her way to Truxillo, and more southern ports,
for which she had a mixed freight of cheap articles
of American manufacture.  She would start north
again from Costa Rica, should she be able to find
a cargo, so O'Rourke and Hemming had both given
manuscripts and letters to the Nova Scotia skipper,
for mailing at the first likely opportunity, with word
that they would wire an address later.  This done,
the adventurers purchased three undersized mules.
O'Rourke picked up what he could in the way of
an outfit, having left everything but his pipe and
poncho in the Cuban bush.  They loaded one of the
mules with their belongings, and put it in charge
of John Nunez, and, mounting the others, started
south, skirting the coast.  The trip was uneventful,
but Hemming wrote a number of stories descriptive
of the country and the people, the mules and his
companions, under the general title of "Along New
Trails with Old Mules."  O'Rourke regarded his
friend's display of energy with kindly disdain.
</p>

<p>
"There is bigger game to seaward," he said, and
seemed ever on the lookout for rumours of war from
the northeast.  After three weeks' easy travelling,
they awoke one morning to find that John Nunez
had taken his departure during the night, and, along
with his departure, one of their mules, a bag of
hardtack and a slab of bacon.
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke looked relieved.  "I've often wondered
how I could ever get rid of him, you know.  I once
saved his life," he said.
</p>

<p>
"It's a good thing we happened to be using the
rest of the provisions for pillows, or, by gad, your
precious servant would have left us to starve,"
replied Hemming, in injured tones.
</p>

<p>
"Cheer up, old man," laughed O'Rourke.  "We're
not three miles from the coast, and I'll bet we are
within ten of a village of some sort," he explained.
</p>

<p>
He was right, for by noon they were sitting at
their ease before black coffee and a Spanish
omelette, in a shabby eating-house.  The town was one
of some importance&mdash;in its own eyes.  Also it
interested Hemming.  But O'Rourke sniffed.
</p>

<p>
"Gay colours and bad smells&mdash;I've experienced
the whole thing before," said he.
</p>

<p>
"Then why the devil did you leave the <i>Laura</i>?"
asked Hemming, pouring himself another glass of
doubtful claret.
</p>

<p>
"To look after you," retorted O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
"But, seriously," urged the Englishman.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if you will be serious," confessed the
freelance, "I'll admit that it's in my blood.  I might
have gone to New York and waited till further
developments in Cuba; but I could no more see
you go ashore, to waste your time and money, without
wanting to follow suit, than you could see me
buy that high-priced claret without wanting to drink
it all yourself."
</p>

<p>
Hemming turned his monocle upon his friend in
mild and curious regard.
</p>

<p>
"I doubt if there is another chap alive," he said,
"who can write such wisdom and talk such rot as
you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, go easy," expostulated O'Rourke, "you've
only read one article of mine&mdash;the twenty-page
result of five weeks' sugar-cane and observation."
</p>

<p>
"It was remarkable stuff," mused Hemming.
</p>

<p>
The younger man had the grace to bow.  "You
don't look like the kind of chap who is lavish with
his praise," he said.
</p>

<p>
Lighting a potent local cigar, he leaned back in
his rickety chair, and shouted something in Spanish.
The owner of the place appeared, rubbing his hands
together and bowing.  He was a fat, brown man,
smelling of native cookery and native tobacco.
O'Rourke talked, at some length, in Spanish, only
a few words of which could Hemming understand.
The proprietor waved his cigarette and gabbled back.
Again O'Rourke took up the conversation, and this
time his flow of mongrel Spanish was pricked out
with bluff English oaths.
</p>

<p>
Hemming asked what it was all about.  O'Rourke
gave himself up to laughter.
</p>

<p>
"I have been trying to sell our mules," he said,
at last, "but find that the market is already glutted."
</p>

<p>
Hemming shook his head disconsolately.  "I fail
to see the joke," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Mine host here informs me that a Cuban gentleman
arrived shortly after daylight this morning,"
continued O'Rourke, "and sold a mule to the
American consul."
</p>

<p>
"Our mule," gasped the enlightened Englishman&mdash;then,
leaping from his chair with a violence that
caused the fat proprietor to take refuge behind a
table, he cried that there was still a chance of
overtaking the rascal.  O'Rourke begged him to finish
his claret in peace.  "And don't do anything rash,"
he said, "for I warn you that if you catch him
you'll have to keep him.  I tremble even now, lest
he should enter the door and reclaim me as his
master."  He blew a thin wisp of smoke toward the
ceiling, and laughed comfortably.  Then his glance
lowered to his friend, who had reseated himself at
the other side of the table.  He saw amazement
and consternation written large in Hemming's face.
The landlord also looked thunderstruck, standing
with his mouth open, his eyes fixed upon the door,
and a dirty napkin idle in his hand.  O'Rourke
turned and followed their enraptured gaze&mdash;and
behold, clothed in new trousers and gaudy poncho,
John Nunez bowing on the threshold.
</p>

<p>
For long seconds a painful silence held the
inmates of the eating-house in thrall.  The
delinquent broke it with a stream of talk.  He pointed
heavenward; he touched his breast with his fingers;
he spread his arms wide, and all the while he
gabbled in Spanish.  Tears ran down his dusky cheeks.
O'Rourke regained his easy attitude, and heard the
story to the end.  He kept his gaze upon the Cuban's
face, and not once did the Cuban meet it.  At last
the fellow stopped talking, and stood before his
master with his sullen, tear-stained face half-hidden
in a fold of his gay blanket.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" inquired Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"He says that he meant no harm," replied
O'Rourke, "but that the desire to steal was like
fever in his blood.  He swears this by more saints
than I know the name of.  He says that he will give
me the money that he got for the mule, and will
toil for me until the day of his death, without a
dollar of wages.  But he has sworn all these things
before, and every fit of repentance seems to make
him more of a rogue.  As for wages&mdash;why, his
grub costs more than he is worth."
</p>

<p>
"Just let me take him in hand," said Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"You may try," assented O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
By this time, and knowing his master's easy
nature, Nunez was feeling more at home.  The
attitude of the penitent was not natural to him.  He
freed one arm from the folds of his poncho and
calmly extracted a cigarette from his sash.  This
he was about to light when Hemming's voice
arrested him in the act.
</p>

<p>
"Throw away that cigarette," came the order.
</p>

<p>
The Cuban feigned ignorance of the English
language.  He raised his eyebrows, paused a second
to smile insolently, and lit the frail roll of black
tobacco with a flourish.  He inhaled the first puff
with very evident pleasure, and let it escape by
way of his nostrils.  But he did not draw the second,
for Hemming's hand landed unexpectedly upon the
side of his head.  The cigarette flew at a tangent,
unrolling as it hit the earthen floor.  The Cuban
span completely around, reeled for a second, and
then sprang at the Englishman with drawn knife.
O'Rourke and the half-breed Mexican cried a warning.
They might have saved their breath for their
next long walk, for Hemming, quick as a terrier
in his movements, stepped to one side and delivered
a remarkable blow with his fist.  The Cuban&mdash;a
flash of gay clothing and harmless knife-blade&mdash;went,
backward, through the narrow doorway.
</p>

<p>
"And now," said Hemming to O'Rourke, "what
are we to do next?"
</p>

<p>
"Do next?" repeated O'Rourke, sadly, "why,
just sit and whistle for the fifty Mexican dollars,
which the American consul paid John for our mule."
</p>

<p>
Hemming hurried to the door and looked up and
down the glaring street.  Nunez was nowhere to be
seen.
</p>

<p>
"He's not lying around anywhere, shamming
dead, is he?" inquired O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
"Don't see him," replied Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Then now is our chance to shake him for good,"
said the other, "and the only way I can think of
is to put out to sea."
</p>

<p>
As if he had made the most reasonable suggestion
in the world, he paid their score and stepped into the
street.  Hemming followed to the water-front, too
deep in wonder to offer objections, or demand explanations.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
HEMMING HEARS OF THE VILLAIN
</h3>

<p>
Six days later, in a club in Kingston, Jamaica,
Hemming ran across a naval officer whom he had
met, years ago, at a county ball.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, left the army?" asked the sailor.
</p>

<p>
"Verily," replied Hemming, who could not recall
the other's name.
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;more money?"
</p>

<p>
"Less."
</p>

<p>
"Nice scandal in your old regiment.  You're well
out of it."
</p>

<p>
"I have heard nothing.  We rather prided
ourselves on our respectability."
</p>

<p>
"A chap called Penthouse," ran on the sailor,
"has turned out a regular sneak-thief.  The others
began to miss things&mdash;money and cuff-links, and
trifles like that&mdash;and one day the colonel caught
him in his room pocketing a gold watch.  I believe
the poor beggar was hard up&mdash;at least so my
correspondent says."
</p>

<p>
At this point he noticed the pallor of Hemming's
face.
</p>

<p>
"Not a friend of yours, I hope," he added, hastily.
</p>

<p>
"Far from it, but he is related to some people I
know very well," replied Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"He was a low cur, even before he turned thief,"
said the talkative sailor, "and Jones tells me he
fleeced an awfully decent, but stupid sort of chap&mdash;"  He
came to a full stop, and glared blankly at his
new-found acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," laughed Hemming, who had regained
his composure as the navy man lost his.
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;damn silly break, wasn't it?" gabbled the
other, turning to O'Rourke, "but you two'll come
aboard to-morrow, and have lunch with us.  One-thirty,
and there's a turtle in the pot."  He left the
club without waiting for an answer.
</p>

<p>
Hemming and O'Rourke had made the voyage
from Honduras to Kingston in a fifty-foot schooner.
For passage-money they had handed over the two
mules, together with the residue of their provisions.
Things are not as cheap as they look in Central
America.  O'Rourke had navigated the vessel, for
the owner had proved himself useless, and Hemming
had hauled on sheets and halyards and worked the
antiquated pump.  But in time they had arrived
safely in Kingston, and never had hot water and
clean food felt and tasted so good.  Hemming had
mailed his "copy," O'Rourke had gone to a tailor;
and now they lived at ease, and awaited checks and
letters from the North.  The friendship of these two
had been an assured thing from the moment of their
first meeting, in the chart-room of the <i>Laura</i>, and
it had grown steadily with every adventure and
hardship in common.  They respected each other's
dauntless spirits and literary styles.  Hemming
admired O'Rourke's cheerful heart, and his faculty
(almost amounting to genius) for getting out of
tight places.  He also liked his manners, and envied
him the length of his limbs.  O'Rourke, in his turn,
admired his comrade's knowledge of things in
general, and the way in which he kept quiet about
incidents in his past, without sulkiness.  He liked
his hasty, forgiving temper, and felt an almost
personal anger toward whatever, or whoever, had
embittered his life; and he considered him as well
set-up a middleweight as he had ever seen.  From
O'Rourke, Hemming learned to do things for
himself&mdash;little things like rolling a blanket, frying
bacon, and pitching a tent.  In the past there had
always been a Mr. Thomas Atkins to look after
such trifles.  Also he learned that no knowledge
comes amiss to a roving newspaper man, from the
science of navigation to the art of sewing on patches,
and the low occupation of grooming a mule.  He
realized how much more comfortable his life in the
army, and his travelling in Greece and Turkey
would have been, had he been able to turn his own
hand to the things other people had left undone.
His heart warmed toward his instructor.  One
night, while they were smoking on the veranda of
their hotel, and looking away at the lights in the
harbour, he told a little of his story&mdash;something of
Penthouse, and something of the girl he loved.  But
he did not mention her name, and, much to his
relief, O'Rourke did not seem curious about it.  That
was one of O'Rourke's most comfortable characteristics.
It was really a matter of breeding.  He was
deeply interested in whatever a person chose to tell
him, and he would put helpful questions which did
not call for further confessions; but he never tried
to draw a man.  One might safely tell him that one's
grandmother had been a cannibal, without fear of
being asked any question concerning one's
grandfather.  If he really wanted to know, he would go
quietly to some one else for the information.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after arriving in Jamaica, Hemming
wrote a letter to Anderson, his particular friend in
the Engineers.  He mentioned having heard of
Penthouse's outbreak, but said nothing of the
occurrences of his last visit to London.  He told, at a
length suggestive of his profession, of the trip
through Yucatan and Honduras, of his new friend,
and of the adventurous passage from the coast of
Central America to Kingston.  He sang the praises
of a free life and the glories of the tropics.  He
spoke of his success with the syndicate, and the
probability of fighting in Cuba in the near future.
He tried hard to make every line of the letter echo
contentment, knowing that Anderson would, very
likely, retail its contents to Miss Travers.
</p>

<p>
"My God," he said, "I was fool enough, once, to
let her see the wound she made, but once is for all."
</p>

<p>
For the remainder of the morning O'Rourke
found him in a low mood, and after trying, in vain,
to raise his spirits with a new cigar as long as a
riding-boot, he smoked the weed himself and wrote
a ballad about pirates and blood.  It was the ballad,
complete after an hour's work, that did the business
for Hemming.  The swinging lines and rolling
phrases, the fearful sea-oaths and unexpected
rhymes started him in action.  At first he was not
sure whether he wanted to ride or write, but, with
a little tactful persuasion from O'Rourke, decided
on the former.  They hired a couple of horses, went
to the club, and drew several of their friends of
H.M.S. <i>Thunderer</i>, and rode for hours, lunching
late, out of town.
</p>

<p>
One morning Hemming received a cablegram
from Dodder, of the New York Syndicate, telling
him to stand ready for orders, and that a letter
followed.  In a few days the letter came.  It was
a friendly, though businesslike epistle, and
contained a check.  It ran as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"MY DEAR CAPTAIN HEMMING:&mdash;Your stories
reached me, and were immediately set up and
distributed broadcast.  They please me, as does all your
work.  I got a check from Wells for the amount of
two months' expenses (at the rate we agreed upon),
and your salary, up to date, has been marked to
your credit.  I believe there will be trouble in Europe
before long, and we hear that Devlin, of whom I
spoke to you, is down with some sort of fever.  Be
prepared to start East at the shortest notice, and
please look up some one, an experienced man, of
course, to keep an eye on Cuba for us, should you
have to leave.  A man who knows the country, and
is immune from yellow fever, would be of more
value than an experienced journalist.  We have
journalists here, but I fear they would fall down
on the job.  I do not believe the Cuban affair will
ever come to more than skirmishing, but even that
is interesting when it happens at our own back door.
No mail has come to us for you.  Please write us if
you know of a man.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Yours very sincerely,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"WASHINGTON DODDER, Manager."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Hemming read it to O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
"Will you accept the job?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, when some one lands an invading army,
but not before," replied O'Rourke.  "Fact is, I'm
afraid to sneak into the place again.  The Spaniards
know me too well.  I've run away with Gomez and
I've retreated with Garcia, and I've had quite enough
of it.  But if you have to leave and I can't get a
chance to go along with you, I'll keep my eye on
things, and do what a man can.  I can at least send
them some photographs of starving women and
babies with distended tummies.  I notice, by the
magazines, that the popular fancy is turning toward
sweet pictures of that kind, and, as luck would have
it, I indulged in photography last time I was there,
and the films happened to be in my pocket when John
and I sailed away."
</p>

<p>
Thus did Bertram St. Ives O'Rourke, the free-lance who
hated to move or stay at any man's bidding,
fetter himself with the chain of duty, and
become the servant of a great syndicate.  But for
weeks he did not feel the chain, but made merry
with sailors and landsmen, and did inspired work
for <i>Griffin's Magazine</i>.  At last word came to
Hemming, calling him to the East to report the actions
of the wily Turk and courageous Greek, and,
after putting his friend aboard the mail-boat,
O'Rourke sat down and grappled the fact of his
own responsibilities.  After due consideration he
wrote to the syndicate, explained his position,
mentioned his past efforts in Cuba, and promised some
interesting cables if they would send him enough
money to charter a tug.  To his amazement (his
name carried more weight than he knew) they wired
the money and told him to go ahead.
</p>

<p>
Thus it happened that within eight days of one
another's departure, and after an intimate and
affectionate friendship, Herbert Hemming sailed for one
battle-field and Bertram St. Ives O'Rourke for
another, and one stout gentleman in New York paid
all the pipers.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
AN ELDERLY CHAMPION
</h3>

<p>
While Herbert Hemming tried to ease the bitterness
of his heart and forget the injustice that had
been done him, in new scenes and amid new
companions, Miss Travers suffered at home.  Her lover
had scarcely left the house before misgivings tore
her.  Now, alone and shaken with grief, she saw
upon what treasonable foundation she had accused an
honourable man of&mdash;she hardly knew what.  Why
had he listened to her?  Why had he not laughed,
and kissed away her awful, hysterical foolishness?
Then she remembered how she had repulsed his
caress, and there in the narrow, heavily furnished
drawing-room she leaned her head upon her arms
and prayed.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later she was startled by the ringing
of the door-bell, and hastened to her own room.
</p>

<p>
The caller was an elderly bachelor brother of her
mother's&mdash;a man with a small income, a taste for
bridge, and tongue and ears for gossip.  His visits
were always welcome to Mrs. Travers.  Mrs.
Travers was a stout lady much given to family
prayers, scandal, and disputes with servants.  As the
widow of a bishop she felt that she filled, in the
being of the nation, a somewhat similar position
to that occupied by Westminster Abbey.  She doted
on all those in temporal and spiritual authority,
almost to the inclusion of curates and subalterns,&mdash;if
they had expectations.  Once upon a time,
seeing nothing larger in sight for her daughter, she
had been Herbert Hemming's motherly friend.
Then she had heard from Mr. Penthouse (who was
poor and dissipated, and might some day become
a baronet) that Hemming's fortune was not nearly
so large as people supposed.  At first she had watched
the change in her daughter, under Penthouse's
influence, with vague alarm; but a suspicion of more
eligible suitors in the offing stilled her fears.  The
hints which her pleasing nephew brought to her, of
Hemming's double life, inflamed her righteous anger
against the quiet captain.  Had her daughter's lover
been the master of five thousand a year she would
have admonished Penthouse to keep silence concerning
the affairs of his superiors.  As it was, she
thought her righteous indignation quite genuine, for
few people of her kind know the full extent of their
respectable wickedness.  Then had come news,
through her daughter, of Hemming's retirement
from the army and entrance into journalism.  Molly
had mentioned it, very quietly, one morning at
breakfast.  Then had come Hemming himself, and
with vast satisfaction she had heard him leave the
house without any bright laughter at the door.  And
just as she had determined to descend and soothe
Molly with words of pious comfort, her brother had
arrived.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Travers heard Molly go to her room and
close the door.  She decided that charity would keep
better than Mr. Pollin's gossip, so she descended to
the drawing-room as fast as her weight would allow.
They shook hands cordially; after which Mr. Pollin
stood respectfully until his sister got safely
deposited in the strongest chair in the room.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pollin was a gossip, as I have previously
stated, but many of his stories were harmless.  He
dressed in the height of fashion, and, in spite of his
full figure, carried himself jauntily.  In his youth
(before he had come in for his modest property, and
mastered whist) he had studied law, and it was
rumoured that he had even tried to write scholarly
articles and book reviews for the daily press.  At
one stage in his career his sister and the late bishop
had really trembled for his respectability; but their
fears had proved to be unfounded, for, lacking
encouragement from the editors, Mr. Pollin had settled
down to unbroken conventionality.  Mr. Pollin's
features resembled his sister's, but his mouth was
more given to smiling, and his eyes held a twinkle,
while hers were dimly lit with a gleam of cold
calculation.
</p>

<p>
To-day Mr. Pollin had quite unexpected news, at
first-hand from an Irish acquaintance of his, a Major
O'Grady.  But he did not blurt it out, as a lesser
gossip would have done.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen Harry Penthouse lately?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not for two days," said the lady.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pollin crossed his knees with an effort, and
tried to look over his waistcoat at his polished boots.
</p>

<p>
"He returns to his regiment shortly," added Mrs. Travers.
</p>

<p>
Her brother coughed gently, and scrutinized the
ring on his finger with an intensity that seemed quite
uncalled for.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?" cried the lady, breathless
with the suspense.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, my dear, although I hardly envy
Harry.  I'm afraid he will find his regiment a rather
uncomfortable place," replied Pollin.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean the regiment, or his quarters,
Richard?"
</p>

<p>
"His quarters are comfortable enough for a better
man," replied the elderly dandy, with a slight ring
of emotion in his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Richard," exclaimed the dame, "what are you
hinting about your nephew?"
</p>

<p>
"No nephew of mine," replied the other, "nor
even of yours, I think.  Poor Charles and old Sir
Peter were first cousins, were they not?"
</p>

<p>
"But they were just like brothers," she urged.
</p>

<p>
"It's a pity young Penthouse hadn't been spanked
more in his early youth," remarked Mr. Pollin.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Travers began to feel decidedly uneasy.
Could it be that Harry had, in some way, forfeited
his chances of the estate and title?  Could it be that
the invalid brother, the unsociable, close-fisted one,
had married?  But she did not put the questions.
</p>

<p>
"What rash thing has the young man done?"
she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing rash, but something dashed low,"
answered her brother.  "To-day," he continued, "I
received a letter from a gentleman whom it appears
I've met several times in the country, Major
O'Grady, of the Seventy-Third.  He has evidently
quite forgotten the fact that I am in any way
connected with Harry Penthouse, or interested in
Herbert Hemming, and after several pages of reference
to some exciting rubbers we have had together (I
really cannot recall them to mind), he casually tells
me the inner history of Hemming's leaving the
service."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I thought so," sighed Mrs. Travers.
</p>

<p>
"Thought what, my dear sister?" asked Pollin,
shortly.
</p>

<p>
The good lady was somewhat confused by the
abruptness of her brother's manner, and her guard
was forgotten.
</p>

<p>
"That the inner history," she replied, "is that
Captain Hemming was requested to resign his
commission."
</p>

<p>
"You have jumped the wrong way, Cordelia,"
said the gentleman, with a disconcerting smile, "for
the regiment, from the colonel to the newest
subaltern, and from the sergeant-major to the youngest
bugler, are, figuratively speaking, weeping over his
departure."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Travers seemed to dwindle in her chair.
"Then why did he retire?" she asked, in a thin
whisper.
</p>

<p>
"Because Harry Penthouse wolfed all his money.
At first he borrowed a hundred or so, and lost it
gambling.  Hemming got a bit shy, but thought,
of course, that some day it would all be paid back.
He wanted to help the boy, so, after a good deal
of persuasion, endorsed his note for a large sum,
and the note was cashed by a Jew who had helped
Penthouse before.  The Jew was honest, but he came
a cropper himself, and could not afford to renew
the note.  Penthouse had only enough left to
carry him stylishly over his two months' leave, so
Hemming had to stump up.  O'Grady says he didn't
get so much as a 'Thank you' from the young
bounder."
</p>

<p>
For several minutes the lady kept a stunned
silence.  Presently she braced herself, and laughed
unmusically.
</p>

<p>
"I have heard a very different story," she said,
"and I believe from a better authority than this
Major O'Brady."
</p>

<p>
"O'Grady," corrected Pollin, "and a very dear
friend of mine&mdash;cousin to Sir Brian O'Grady."
</p>

<p>
The good fellow's imagination was getting the
bit in its teeth by this time, and his mind was
turning toward the quiet of his club, and a nip of
something before dinner.
</p>

<p>
"You have your choice between Major O'Grady's
story and Harry Penthouse's," said the lady.
</p>

<p>
"And I choose O'Grady's," replied the gentleman,
"because I know Penthouse and I know Herbert.
Herbert is a good soldier and a good sort, and Harry
is a damned overgrown, overfed cad."
</p>

<p>
He stole away without farewell, abashed and
surprised at his own heat and breach of etiquette.
</p>

<p>
After her brother's departure Mrs. Travers
sought her daughter.  She wanted to know all the
particulars of Hemming's visit.
</p>

<p>
"It is all over between us," sobbed the girl, and
beyond that she could learn nothing.  Having failed
to receive information, she immediately began to
impart some, and told what Mr. Pollin had heard
from Major O'Grady.  Molly, who lay on the bed,
kept her face buried in the pillow, and showed no
signs of hearing anything.  At last her mother left
her, after saying that she would send her dinner up
to her.  The bewildered woman had never felt quite
so put about since the death of the lord bishop.
Could it be, she wondered, that she had made a
mistake in encouraging Harry Penthouse's work
tearing down Molly's belief in Hemming?  Even
her dinner did not altogether reassure her troubled
spirit.
</p>

<p>
Several days later Miss Travers wrote to Hemming.
It contained only a line or two.  It begged
his forgiveness.  It called him to return and let her
show her love.  She sent it to his old address in
Dublin, and in the corner wrote "Please forward."
</p>

<br>
&quot;SEVERAL DAYS LATER MISS TRAVERS WROTE TO HEMMING&quot;
</p>

<p>
Now it happened that Private Malloy, who had
once been Captain Hemming's orderly, was sent one
day, by a sergeant, for the officers' mail.  He thought
himself a sly man, did Mr. Malloy, and when he
found a letter addressed to his late beloved master,
in a familiar handwriting, he decided that it was
from "one of them dunnin' Jews," and carefully
separated it from the pile.  Later he burned it.
"One good turn deserves another," said he, watching
the thin paper flame and fade.
</p>

<p>
Penthouse returned to his regiment without
calling again on Molly and Mrs. Travers.  Somehow,
after the beating he had received, he did not feel
like showing his face anywhere in town.  Day after
day Molly waited for an answer to her letter.  By this
time she had heard, from Captain Anderson (who
had acted nervously during his short call), of
Hemming's intention of going immediately to Greece.
So for two weeks she waited hopefully.  Then the
horrible fear that she had hurt him beyond
pardoning, perhaps even disgusted him, grew upon her.
But for more than a month every brisk footfall on
the pavement and every ring at the door-bell set her
heart burning and left it throbbing with pain.
</p>

<p>
When she drove with her mother she scanned
the faces of the men in the street, and often and
often she changed colour at sight of a thin, alert
face or broad, gallant shoulders in the crowd.
</p>

<p>
Captain Anderson was at Aldershot when he
received his friend's letter from Jamaica.  He went
up to town and called on Miss Travers, and, without
so much as "by your leave," read her extracts from
the letter.  She listened quietly, with downcast eyes
and white face.  When he was through with it she
looked at him kindly; but her eyes were dim.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you taunt me?" she asked.  "Is it
because you are his friend?"  The smile that
followed the question was not a happy one.
</p>

<p>
The sapper's honest face flamed crimson.  "I
thought you wanted to know about him," he stammered.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am glad to hear that he is so
successful&mdash;and so happy," she replied, and her mouth
took on a hardness strange and new to it.  She
remembered the passionate appeal in her own
letter&mdash;the cry of love that had awakened no answering
cry&mdash;and her pride and anger set to work to tear
the dreams from her heart.  But a dream built by
the Master Workman, of stuffs lighter than the
wind, outlasts the heavy walls of kings' monuments.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
HEMMING UNDERTAKES A DIGNIFIED WORK
</h3>

<p>
Hemming went through the Turko-Grecian campaign
from beginning to end, with much credit to
himself and profit to the syndicate.  He worked
hard, and, on occasions, risked life and limb.  No
word of legitimate news of actions got out of the
country ahead of his.  When the fighting was over,
he wrote a careful article on the uselessness of the
sword in modern battles.  He described the few
occasions in which he had seen a blooded sword in
action.  He damned them all&mdash;the pointed blade
of the infantry officer, and the cutting sabre of the
cavalry trooper.  They would do for hill raids, or
charges against savages, but before the steady fire
of men on foot, armed with rifles of the latest
pattern, they were hopeless.  Their day had passed
with the passing of the ramrod, he said.  After
heading it "Cold Steel in Modern Warfare," he
decided that it would be a pity to waste it on the
New York News Syndicate; for of late he had
become dissatisfied with his arrangements with the
syndicate.  He had found that, out of the dozen
or more war-correspondents whom he had met
during the campaign, only two were allowed so small
a sum as he for expenses, and not one was paid so
small a salary.  So he mailed his wise story to a
big London weekly, and wrote to Dodder for a raise
in his salary and expenses.  At this time he was
living quietly in Athens, with a number of
friends,&mdash;merry fellows, all,&mdash;but he missed O'Rourke's
whimsical conversations and kindly comradeship.
</p>

<p>
The big London weekly published Hemming's
article, and commented upon it editorially.  It also
sent him a modest check&mdash;more modest than its
size and reputation would lead one to suppose.
Mr. Dodder's letter arrived at about the same time.  The
manager of the syndicate was firm, though gentle.
He pointed out that already Hemming drew more
money than any other correspondent connected with
the concern.  He explained that, even now,
Mr. Wells frequently grumbled.  "And after all," he
concluded, "you are a new man, and we are helping
you to a reputation."
</p>

<p>
"We'll see about that," said Hemming, and wrote
to say that he would like to take a holiday until
more fighting turned up.  He sent them his address
for the next six months&mdash;Maidmill-on-Dee,
Cheshire, England.  Then he sold his horse, packed
his things, and sailed for England.
</p>

<p>
At Maidmill-on-Dee, in a stone cottage with a
slated roof, lived an old couple named Thomson.
During the brief married life of Hemming's parents,
these two good folk had looked after their bodily
welfare&mdash;Thomson as gardener and groom, and
Mrs. Thomson as cook.  Hemming's father, though
well connected, had made his livelihood as a country
doctor.  The people in Maidmill-on-Dee still
remembered him as a handsome, generous man with
the manner of a lord lieutenant of the county, and
with always a good horse in his stables.  Hemming's
mother had been the daughter of a scholarly, though
poor, country vicar.  She had been a beauty in a
frail, white way, and a lover of her husband, her
home, and good literature.  When the doctor had
died of blood-poisoning, contracted during a simple
operation upon one of his many poor patients, she
had tried, for awhile, to take heart again, but had
followed him within a year.  After the deaths of the
parents a wealthy relative had remembered the son,
and, finding him a youth of promise, had given him
some money.
</p>

<p>
Hemming drove from the station in the public
bus.  He passed the house where so much of his
earlier years had been spent, and told the driver
to take him to Joseph Thomson's.  They rattled
down the quiet, single street, and drew up at the
stone threshold.  He helped the driver pile his bags
and boxes beside the door.  Then he dismissed the
conveyance, and paused for awhile before entering
the cottage, with a warm, new feeling of homecoming
in his heart.  The low, wide kitchen was
unoccupied, but the door leading to the garden
behind stood open.  He sat down in a well-worn chair
and looked about.  The October sunlight lit up the
dishes on the dresser.  A small table by a window
was laid with plates and cups for two.  He heard
voices in the garden.  A woman, stout and gray-haired,
entered with a head of Brussels sprouts in
her hand, and with her cotton skirt kilted up,
displaying a bright, quilted petticoat.  Hemming got up
from his chair, but she was not looking toward him,
and she was evidently hard of hearing.  He stepped
in front of her and laid his hands on her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Susan," he said, beaming.
</p>

<p>
"Lor', Master Bert," she exclaimed, "you're still
at your tricks."
</p>

<p>
In a flutter of delight she smacked him squarely
on the mouth, and then, blushing and trembling,
begged his pardon.
</p>

<p>
"I can't think you're a grown-up man," she
explained.  She surveyed him at arm's length.
</p>

<p>
"You're not overly big," she said, "an' that's
a fact.  But you're surprising thick through the chest
and wide i' the shoulders.  An' who'd ever have
looked for Master Bert, all so suddent, i'
Maidmill-on-Dee."
</p>

<p>
By this time she was in a fair way to burst into
tears, so fast were the old memories crowding upon
her.  Hemming feared tears more than the devil,
and, patting her violently on the back, forced her
into a chair.
</p>

<p>
"There, Susan, there.  Now keep cool and fire
low, and tell me what you are going to have for
lunch?" he urged.
</p>

<p>
"Thomson," she called, "there is a gentleman
here as wants to see you."
</p>

<p>
"Bes there, now?" said Thomson, and rubbed
his hands on his smock.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind your hands," she called.
</p>

<p>
Thomson scraped his heavy way into the kitchen,
and blinked at the visitor.
</p>

<p>
"Howde, sir," he remarked, affably.
</p>

<p>
"How are you, Thomson?  Glad to see you
again," said Hemming, extending his hand.
</p>

<p>
The old gardener gave back a step, with a slight
cry and an uptossing of gnarled hands.
</p>

<p>
He recovered himself with an effort.
</p>

<p>
"God bless me, it's Master Herbert," he
exclaimed.  "Do you know, missus, I thought it was
the doctor askin' how I was," he continued, turning
to his wife, "but the master was a more sizable
man,&mdash;yes, an' redder i' the face."
</p>

<p>
"Ay," replied Mrs. Thomson, "but hansome is
as hansome does&mdash;meanin' nothin' disrespectful
about the old master, God bless his memory, dear
man,&mdash;and Master Bert is a fine appearin' young
gentleman."
</p>

<p>
The gaffer nodded.  "The lasses wud believe you,
missus," he said.
</p>

<p>
"What lasses do you mean?" inquired the old
woman, sharply.  "Where's the lass i' this village
fit to believe anything about one o' the queen's
officers&mdash;tell me that."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, I was sayin' nothin'," replied Thomson.
</p>

<p>
The woman looked quizzically at Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Like enough there's a young lady in Lunnon,"
she suggested.
</p>

<p>
"There is no young lady&mdash;anywhere," said
Hemming, "and I'm no longer in the army.  I'm
at another trade now."
</p>

<p>
"Trade?" exclaimed Thomson.
</p>

<p>
"Well, hardly that," laughed Hemming.  "I
write for a living."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Thomson nodded with satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"The queen's son-in-law wrote a book," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I hardly do that kind," said Hemming, uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"I vum you don't, sir," cried the man, whacking
the table, "not if the missus means the book she
read to me out of, oncet."
</p>

<p>
Hemming was pleased with the old man's shrewdness,
though Mrs. Thomson was shocked at his
insinuations.
</p>

<p>
Hemming settled down in the cottage, much to
the delight of the old couple.  A fair-sized room
on the ground floor was given over to him, for
bedroom and study.  The success of his last article
had suggested to him the writing of a book about
what he knew, and had seen, of the last brief
campaign&mdash;something more lasting than his syndicate
work, and more carefully done.  This work would
have colour, not too heavily splashed on; style, not
too aggressive; and dignity befitting the subject.
He decided that he must prune his newspaper style
considerably for the book.  So he settled down to
his work, and after three days' honest labour, all that
stood of it was the title, "Where Might Is
Right."  Strange to say, this seeming failure did not
discourage him.  He knew what he had to say, and
felt that as soon as the right note for the expression
of it was struck, it would be easy to go on.
The pages he so ruthlessly destroyed were splendid
newspaper copy, but he knew the objection thinking
men have to finding newspaper work between the
covers of a book.  But at last the opening chapter
was done to his taste; and after that the work was
easy and pleasant.  It soon became his habit to get
out of bed in time to breakfast with Thomson, who
was a thrifty market-gardener on a small scale.
After his breakfast he smoked a cigar in the garden,
and sometimes told stories of his adventures to his
host.  By eight o'clock he was at his table, writing
rapidly, but not steadily, until twelve o'clock.  After
the simple midday dinner he walked for several
hours, and seldom went back to his work until
candle-time.  In this way, with books and magazines
sent down every week from London, he managed
to put in his time without letting himself think too
often of Molly Travers.  Nothing in the village
reminded him of her, and his healthy days brought
him, for the most part, dreamless nights.
</p>

<p>
The old people were immensely interested in
Hemming and his work.  They even persuaded him
to read some of the chapters of his book aloud to
them.  It was plain to Hemming that Mrs. Thomson's
signs of appreciation were matters more of
the heart than the head; but not so with Thomson.
He would applaud a convincing argument or a
well-turned sentence by slapping his hand on his knee,
and for hours after a reading would sit by the
chimney and mumble curses on the heads of the Turks.
One morning, while Hemming was watching him at
his work, he turned from the bonfire he had been
tending and, without preamble, grasped his lodger's
hand.
</p>

<p>
"You've a power of brains inside your head, sir,"
he said, with vehemence.  Hemming felt that, even
from O'Rourke, he had never received a more pleasing
compliment.  He rewarded the gaffer with a
cigar from his own case.
</p>

<p>
By Christmas "Where Might Is Right" was finished,
and posted to a London publisher.  With this
work done, restlessness returned to Hemming.  He
fought it off for awhile, but at last packed a bag
with his best clothes, and, telling Mrs. Thomson to
take care of his letters until his return, went up
to London.  First of all he called on the publishers
to whom he had sent his book.  The manager was
in, and received Hemming cordially.  He said that
he had not yet looked at Hemming's manuscript,
and that at present it was in town, having been taken
away to a house-party by their literary adviser.
However, he had followed Captain Hemming's
career as a war-correspondent and writer of army
stories with interest, and felt that it was altogether
likely that the firm would want to do business with
him.  The genial glow of the season must have been
in the gentleman's blood, for he cordially invited
Hemming to lunch with him at his club.  Upon
reaching the street Hemming found the fog, which
had been scarcely noticeable a short time before, was
rapidly thickening.
</p>

<p>
"Let us walk&mdash;it is but a step," said the
publisher, "and I've made the trip in every kind of
weather for the last twenty years."
</p>

<p>
On the steps of the club Hemming stumbled
against a crouched figure.  There was a dull yellow
glare from the lamp above, and by it Hemming saw
the beggar's bloated, hungry face, bedraggled red
beard, and trembling hand.  The eyes were cunning
and desperate, but pitiful just then.  Hemming
passed the poor fellow a coin,&mdash;a two-shilling
piece,&mdash;and followed his guide into the warm, imposing
hall of the club, wondering where he had seen those
unscrupulous eyes before.  The club was brightly
lighted.  The lunch was long and complicated and
very good.  The publisher was vastly entertaining,
and seemed in no hurry to get back to his work.
Hemming's thoughts, in spite of the cheer, busied
themselves with the beggar on the steps.
</p>

<p>
"Did you notice the beggar outside?" he asked,
at last.
</p>

<p>
"The chap with the bushy beard?&mdash;why, yes,
he is new to this quarter," replied the other.
</p>

<p>
"He was a desperate-looking devil, and I think
the beard was false," remarked Hemming.  But as
his host did not seem interested in either the beggar
or his beard, the subject was dropped.
</p>

<p>
Next day, with an unnamed hope in his heart that
something might happen, Hemming passed the
Travers house.  But the hope died at sight of it,
for it was clearly unoccupied!  He remained in town
a few days longer, seeking familiar faces in familiar
haunts, and finding none to his mind.  He thought
it strange that romance, and everything worth while,
should have deserted the great city in so brief a
time.  But, for that matter, when he came to think
of it, the whole world had lost colour.  He decided
that he was growing old&mdash;and perhaps too wise.
After standing the genial publisher a dinner, and
receiving a promise of a speedy decision on "Where
Might Is Right," he returned to Maidmill-on-Dee, to
spend weary months awaiting rumour of war.  At
last the rumour came, closely followed by sailing
orders.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
O'ROURKE TELLS A SAD STORY
</h3>

<p>
Upon his arrival in New York, Hemming called
immediately upon Mr. Dodder, in the New York
News Syndicate Building on Fulton Street.  He
found the manager even stouter than at the time
of their first meeting, and of a redder countenance.
His manner was as cordial as before, but his mood
was not so jovial.
</p>

<p>
"I am always worrying about something or other,
and just now it is my health," he told Hemming.
"You don't know what I'd give, captain, for a life
like yours&mdash;and a good hard body like yours.  But
I can't drop this job now.  It's the very devil, I
can tell you, to have one's brain and nerves jumping
and twanging all the time, while one's carcass lolls
about and puts on fat.  I'm sorry I was so smart
when I was a kid.  Otherwise the old man would
not have sent me to college, and I'd never have
hustled myself into this slavery.  My father was a
lumberman, and so was my grandfather.  They had
big bodies, just like mine, but they lived the right
kind of lives for their bodies."
</p>

<p>
Hemming felt sorry for him.  He saw that the
gigantic body was at strife with the manner of life
to which it was held, and that the same physique that
had proved itself a blessing to the lumberman, was
a menace to the desk-worker.
</p>

<p>
"Better take a few months in the woods," he
suggested.
</p>

<p>
Dodder laughed bitterly.  "You might just as
well advise me to take a few months in heaven," he
said.
</p>

<p>
Hemming asked for news of O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
The manager's face lighted.
</p>

<p>
"O'Rourke," he exclaimed, "is a man wise in
his generation.  Shackles of gold couldn't hold that
chap from his birthright of freedom.  He did us
some fine work for a time,&mdash;rode with Gomez and
got his news out somehow or other,&mdash;but went
under with enteric and left Cuba.  We kept him on,
of course, but as soon as he could move around
again he resigned his position.  He said he had some
very pressing business affair to see to."
</p>

<p>
"Is he well again?" asked Hemming, anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, he's able to travel," replied Dodder.
"He was here only a week ago.  He seems to be
making a tour of the Eastern cities.  I guess he's
looking for something."
</p>

<p>
"An editor, likely, who has lost some of his
manuscripts," remarked Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Or a girl," said the other.
</p>

<p>
"Why a girl?" asked the Englishman.
</p>

<p>
Dodder smiled pensively.  "I like to think so,"
he said, "for though I am nothing but a corpulent
business slave myself, I've a fine active brain for
romance, and the heart of a Lochinvar."
</p>

<p>
Hemming nodded gravely.  Dodder laughed at
him.  "You are thinking what a devilish big horse
I need," he said.
</p>

<p>
They dined together that evening at the Reform
Club, and Hemming was amazed at the quantity of
food the big man consumed.  He had seen O'Rourke,
the long, lean, and broad, sit up to some hearty meals
after a day in the saddle, but never had he met
with an appetite like Dodder's.  It was the appetite
of his ancestral lumbermen, changed a little in taste,
perhaps, but the same in vigour.
</p>

<p>
War was in order between the United States of
America and Spain.  General Shafter's army was
massing in Tampa, Florida, and Hemming, with
letters from the syndicate, started for Washington
to procure a pass from the War Office.  But on the
night before his departure from New York came
news from London of his book, and the first batch
of proof-sheets for correction.  He worked until far
into the morning, and mailed the proofs, together
with a letter, before breakfast.  Arriving in
Washington, he went immediately to the War Department
building, and handed in his letters.  The clerk
returned and asked him to follow to an inner room.
There he found a pale young man, with an imposing,
closely printed document in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Hemming?" inquired the gentleman.
</p>

<p>
Hemming bowed.
</p>

<p>
"Your credentials are correct," continued the
official, "and the Secretary of War has signed your
passport.  Please put your name here."
</p>

<p>
Hemming signed his name on the margin of the
document, folded it, and stowed it in a waterproof
pocketbook, and bowed himself out.  He was about
to close the door behind him when the official called
him back.
</p>

<p>
"You forgot something, captain," said the young
man, holding a packet made up of about half a dozen
letters toward him.
</p>

<p>
"Not I," replied Hemming.  He glanced at the
letters, and read on the top one "Bertram St. Ives
O'Rourke, Esq."
</p>

<p>
"O'Rourke," he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"How stupid of me," cried the young man.
</p>

<p>
"Where is he?  When was he here?" inquired
Hemming.  "He is a particular friend of mine,"
he added.
</p>

<p>
The official considered for a second or two.
</p>

<p>
"Tall chap with a yellow face and a silk hat, isn't
he?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Tall enough," replied Hemming, "but he had
neither a yellow face nor a silk hat when I saw him
last&mdash;that was in Jamaica, about a year ago."
</p>

<p>
At that moment the door opened and O'Rourke
entered.  Without noticing Hemming he gave a
folded paper to the clerk.
</p>

<p>
"You'll find that right enough," he said&mdash;and
then his eye lighted upon his old comrade.  He
grasped the Englishman by the shoulders and shook
him backward and forward, grinning all the while a
wide, yellow grin.
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap," protested Hemming, "where
have you been to acquire this demonstrative nature?"
</p>

<p>
"Lots of places.  Come and have a drink,"
exclaimed O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
"I'll mail that to your hotel," called the pale
young man after them, as they hurried out.
</p>

<p>
"What are you up to now, my son?" inquired
Hemming, critically surveying the other's faultless
attire.  "You look no end of a toff, in spite of your
yellow face."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, and I feel it," replied his friend, "but
my release is at hand, for to-night I shall hie me
to mine uncle's and there deposit these polite and
costly garments.  Already my riding-breeches and
khaki tunic are airing over the end of my bed."
</p>

<p>
"But why this grandeur, and this wandering
about from town to town?" asked Hemming.  He
caught the quick look of inquiry on his friend's
face.  "Dodder told me you'd been aimlessly touring
through the Eastern States," he added.
</p>

<p>
"Here we are&mdash;come in and I'll tell you about
it," replied O'Rourke.  They entered the Army and
Navy Club, and O'Rourke, with a very-much-at-home
air, led the way to a quiet inner room.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose we'll split the soda the same old
way&mdash;as we did before sorrow and wisdom came to us,"
sighed O'Rourke.  He gave a familiar order to the
attentive waiter.  Hemming looked closely at his
companion, and decided that the lightness was only
a disguise.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me the yarn, old boy&mdash;I know it's of more
than fighting and fever," he said, settling himself
comfortably in his chair.
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke waited until the servant had deposited
the glasses and retired.  Then he selected two cigars
from his case with commendable care, and, rolling
one across the table, lit the other.  He inhaled the
first draught lazily.
</p>

<p>
"These are deuced fine cigars," remarked Hemming.
O'Rourke nodded his head, and, with his
gaze upon the blue drift of smoke, began his story.
</p>

<p>
"I was in a very bad way when I got out of that
infernal island last time.  I had a dose of fever
that quite eclipsed any of my former experiences
in that line&mdash;also a bullet-hole in the calf of my
left leg.  Maybe you noticed my limp, and thought
I was feigning gout.  A tug brought me back to
this country, landing me at Port Tampa.  Some
patriotic Cubans were waiting for me, and I made
the run up to Tampa in a car decorated with flags.
I wore my Cuban uniform, you know, and must have
looked more heroic than I felt."
</p>

<p>
Hemming raised his eyebrows at that.
</p>

<p>
"I'm a major in the Cuban army&mdash;the devil
take it," explained O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
"The patriots escorted me to a hotel," he
continued, "but the manager looked at my banana-hued
face and refused to have anything to do with me
at any price.  Failing in this, my tumultuous friends
rushed me to a wooden hospital, at the end of a river
of brown sand which the inhabitants of that town
call an avenue.  I was put to bed in the best room
in the place, and then my friends hurried away, each
one to find his own doctor to offer me.  I was glad
of the quiet, for I felt about as beastly as a man
can feel without flickering out entirely.  I don't
think my insides just then would have been worth
more than two cents to any one but a medical
student.  The matron&mdash;at least that's what they
called her&mdash;came in to have a look at me, and ask
me questions.  She was young, and she was pretty,
and her impersonal manner grieved me even then.
I might have been a dashed pacifico for all the
interest she showed in me, beyond taking my
temperature and ordering the fumigation of my clothes.
I wouldn't have felt so badly about it if she had
not been a lady&mdash;but she was, sure enough, and
her off-hand treatment very nearly made me forget
my cramps and visions of advancing land-crabs.
During the next few days I didn't know much of
anything.  When my head felt a little clearer, the
youthful matron brought me a couple of telegrams.
I asked her to open them, and read them to me.
Evidently my Cuban friends had reported the state
of my health, and other things, for both telegrams
were tender inquiries after my condition.
</p>

<p>
"'You seem to be a person of some importance,'
she said, regarding me as if I were a specimen in
a jar.
</p>

<p>
"'My name is O'Rourke,' I murmured.  For
awhile she stared at me in a puzzled sort of way.
Suddenly she blushed.
</p>

<p>
"'I beg your pardon, Mr. O'Rourke,' she said,
and sounded as if she meant it.  I felt more
comfortable, and sucked my ration of milk and
lime-water with relish.  Next day the black orderly told
me that the matron was Miss Hudson, from somewhere
up North.  He didn't know just where.  I
gave him a verbal order on the hospital for a dollar.
</p>

<p>
"Presently Miss Hudson came in and greeted me
cheerfully.  'Why do you want Harley to have
a dollar?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
"'Just for a tip,' I replied, wearily.
</p>

<p>
"'He is paid to do his work, and if some patients
fee him, the poorer ones will suffer,' she said.
</p>

<p>
"'But I want him to have it, please.  He told
me your name,' I said.
</p>

<p>
"She paid no more attention to this foolish
remark than if I had sneezed.  Indeed, even less, for
if I had sneezed she would have taken my pulse
or my temperature.  I watched her as she moved
about the room seeing that all was clean and in
order.
</p>

<p>
"'Miss Hudson,' I said, gaining courage, 'will
you tell me what is going on in the world?  Have
you a New York paper?'
</p>

<p>
"'Yes, some papers have come for you,' she
answered, 'and I will read to you for a little while,
if you feel strong enough to listen.  There is a letter,
too.  Shall I open it for you?'
</p>

<p>
"She drew a chair between my bed and the window,
and, first of all, examined the letter.
</p>

<p>
"'From the New York News Syndicate,' she said.
</p>

<p>
"'Then it's only a check,' I sighed.
</p>

<p>
"'I shall put it away with the money you had
when you came,' she said.  She opened a paper,
glanced at it, and wrinkled her white brow at me.
</p>

<p>
"'Are you the Bertram St. Ives O'Rourke?" she
asked.
</p>

<p>
"'No, indeed,' I replied.  'He has been dead a
long time.  He was an admiral in the British navy.'
</p>

<p>
"'I have never heard of him,' she answered, 'but
there is a man with that name who writes charming
little stories, and verses, too, I think.'
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, that duffer,' I exclaimed, faintly.
</p>

<p>
"She laughed quietly.  'There is an article about
him here&mdash;at least I suppose it is the same man.'  She
glanced down the page and then up at me.  'An
angel unawares,' she laughed, and chaffed me kindly
about my modesty.
</p>

<p>
"After that we became better friends every day,
though she often laughed at the way some of the
papers tried to make a hero of me.  That hurt me,
because really I had gone through some awful
messes, and been sniped at a dozen times.  The
Spaniards had a price on my head.  I told her that,
but she didn't seem impressed.  As soon as I was
able to see people, my friends the Cuban cigar
manufacturers called upon me, singly and in pairs, each
with a gift of cigars.  These are out of their
offerings.  The more they did homage to me, the less
seriously did Miss Hudson seem to regard my
heroism.  But she liked me&mdash;yes, we were good
friends."
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke ceased talking and pensively flipped the
ash off his cigar.  Leaning back in his chair, he
stared at the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" inquired his friend.  O'Rourke returned
to the narration of his experience with a visible
effort.
</p>

<p>
"After awhile she read to me, for half an hour
or so, every day.  One evening she read a ballad
of my own; by gad, it was fine.  But then, even the
<i>Journal</i> sounded like poetry when she got hold of it.
From that we got to talking about ourselves to each
other, and she told me that she had learned nursing,
after her freshman year at Vassar, because of a
change in her father's affairs.  She had come South
with a wealthy patient, and, after his recovery, had
accepted the position of matron, or head nurse, of
that little hospital.  In return, I yarned away about
my boyhood, my more recent adventures, my friends,
and my ambitions.  At last my doctor said I could
leave the hospital, but must go North right away.
My leg was healed, but otherwise I looked and felt
a wreck.  I was so horribly weak, and my nights
continued so crowded with suffering and delirium,
that I feared my constitution was ruined.  I tried
to keep myself in hand when Miss Hudson was
around, but she surely guessed that I loved her."
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" interrupted Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"I said that I loved her," retorted O'Rourke, defiantly.
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead with the story," said the Englishman.
</p>

<p>
"When the time came for my departure,"
continued O'Rourke, "and the carriage was waiting
at the curb, I just kissed her hand and left without
saying a word.  I came North and got doctors to
examine me.  They said that my heart and lungs
were right as could be, and that the rest of my gear
would straighten up in time.  They promised even
a return of my complexion with the departure of the
malaria from my blood.  But I must live a quiet
life for awhile, they said; so to begin the quiet life
I returned to Tampa, and that hospital.  But I did
not find the girl."
</p>

<p>
"Was she hiding?" inquired Hemming.  "Perhaps
she had heard some stories to your discredit."
</p>

<p>
"No," said O'Rourke, "she had resigned, and
left the town, with her father.  Evidently her
troubles were ended&mdash;just as mine were begun."
</p>

<p>
"What did you do about it?" asked Hemming,
whose interest was thoroughly aroused.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I looked for her everywhere&mdash;in Boston,
and New York, and Baltimore, and Washington, and
read all the city directories," replied the disconsolate
lover, "but I do not know her father's first name,
and you have no idea what a lot of Hudsons there
are in the world."
</p>

<p>
Hemming discarded the butt of his cigar, and eyed
his friend contemplatively.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you looked in the registers of the
Tampa hotels?" he queried.  "The old chap's name
and perhaps his address would be there."
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke started from his chair, with dismay
and shame written on his face.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down and have another," said Hemming;
"we'll look it up in a few days."

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
LIEUTENANT ELLIS IS CONCERNED
</h3>

<p>
By the time Hemming and O'Rourke reached
Tampa, about thirty thousand men had gone under
canvas in the surrounding pine groves and
low-lying waste places.  There were Westerners and
Easterners, regulars and volunteers, and at Port
Tampa a regiment of coloured cavalry.  Troops were
arriving every day.  Colonel Wood and Lieutenant-Colonel
Roosevelt, with their splendid command of
mounted infantry, had just pitched their shelter-tents
in a place of scrub palmetto, behind the big
hotel.  Taken altogether, it was an army that made
Hemming stare.
</p>

<p>
The friends went to a quiet hotel with wide
verandas, cool rooms, open fireplaces, and what proved
equally attractive, reasonable rates.  They inquired
of the clerk about Mr. Hudson.  He remembered
the gentleman well, though he had spent only two
days in the place.  "He had a daughter with him,"
the man informed them, and, turning to the front of
the register, looked up the name.  "There's the
signature, sir, and you're welcome to it," he said.
The correspondents examined it intently for some
time.
</p>

<p>
"We know that <i>that</i> means Hudson," remarked
O'Rourke, at last, "and I should guess <i>John</i> for
the other sprawl."
</p>

<p>
"Sprawl is good," said Hemming, straightening
his monocle, "but any one can see that <i>Robert</i> is
the name."
</p>

<p>
"I've put a lot of study on it," said the clerk,
"and so has the boss, and we've about agreed to
call it <i>Harold</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Take your choice," said O'Rourke, "but tell
me what you make of the address."
</p>

<p>
"Boston," cried the clerk.
</p>

<p>
They stared at him.  "You were all ready," said
Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," he replied, "for I've been thinking it
over for some time."
</p>

<p>
"Why the devil didn't you ask him?" inquired
O'Rourke, fretfully.
</p>

<p>
"Lookee here, colonel," said the hotel man, "if
you know Mr. Hudson, you know darn well why
I didn't ask him where he came from."
</p>

<p>
"High and haughty?" queried O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
The clerk nodded.
</p>

<p>
"You had better reconsider your course, old
chap," laughed the Englishman.
</p>

<p>
His friend did not reply.  He was again intent
on the register.
</p>

<p>
"I make seven letters in it," he said, "and I'll
swear to that for an N."
</p>

<p>
"N nothing," remarked the clerk; "that's a B."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is a B, I think, and to me the word looks
like&mdash;well, like Balloon," said Hemming.
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke sighed.  "Of course it is New York;
see the break in the middle, and a man is more likely
to come from there than from a balloon," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Some men go away in balloons, sir," suggested
the clerk.
</p>

<p>
Just then the proprietor of the hotel entered and
approached the desk.  He Was an imposing figure
of a man, tall and deep, and suitably dressed in the
roomiest of light tweeds.  His face was round and
clever.  He shook hands with the new arrivals.
</p>

<p>
"Military men, I believe," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Not just now," replied Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know where Mr. Hudson is at present?"
asked O'Rourke, in casual tones.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hudson, of Philadelphia?  Why, no, sir,
I can't say that I do," answered the big man.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know he's of Philadelphia?"
asked the Englishman.
</p>

<p>
"He wrote it in the register; look for yourself,"
was the reply.
</p>

<p>
"No," said O'Rourke, mournfully, "but it is a
very dry evening, and if you will honour us with
your company as far as the bar, Mr.&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stillman,&mdash;delighted, sir," hastily replied the
proprietor.
</p>

<p>
The three straightway sought that cool retreat,
leaving the clerk to brood, with wrinkled brow,
above the puzzle so unconsciously donated to him
by a respectable one-time guest.
</p>

<p>
The weary delay in that town of sand and
disorder at last came to an end, and Hemming and
O'Rourke, with their passports countersigned by
General Shafter, went aboard the <i>Olivette</i>.  Most
of the newspaper men were passengers on the same
boat.  During the rather slow trip, they made many
friends and a few enemies.  One of the friends was
a youth with a camera, sent to take pictures for the
same weekly paper which O'Rourke represented.
The landing in Cuba of a part of the invading forces
and the correspondents was made at Baiquiri, on
the southern coast.  The woful mismanagement of
this landing has been written about often enough.
O'Rourke and Hemming, unable to procure horses,
set off toward Siboney on foot, and on foot they
went through to Santiago with the ragged, hungry,
wonderful army.  They did their work well enough,
and were thankful when it was over.  Hemming
admired the American army&mdash;up to a certain
grade.  Part of the time they had a merry Toronto
journalist for messmate, a peaceful family man, who
wore a round straw hat and low shoes throughout
the campaign.  During the marching (but not the
fighting), O'Rourke happened upon several members
of his old command.  One of the meetings took
place at midnight, when the Cuban warrior was in
the act of carrying away Hemming's field-glasses
and the Toronto man's blanket.
</p>

<p>
After the surrender of Santiago, Hemming
received word to cover Porto Rico.  He started at
the first opportunity in a gunboat that had once
been a harbour tug.  O'Rourke, who was anxious to
continue his still hunt for the lady who had nursed
him, returned to Florida, and from thence to New
York.
</p>

<p>
In Porto Rico Hemming had an easy and pleasant
time.  He struck up an acquaintance that soon
warmed to intimacy with a young volunteer lieutenant
of infantry, by name Ellis.  Ellis was a quiet,
well-informed youth; in civil life a gentleman-at-large
with a reputation as a golfer.  With his
command of sixteen men he was stationed just outside
of Ponce, and under the improvised canvas awning
before his door he and Hemming exchanged views
and confidences.  One evening, while the red eyes
of their green cigars glowed and dimmed in the
darkness, Hemming told of his first meeting with
O'Rourke.  He described the little boat tossing
toward them from the vast beyond, the poncho
bellied with the wind, and the lean, undismayed
adventurer smoking at the tiller.  Ellis sat very quiet,
staring toward the white tents of his men.
</p>

<p>
"Is that the same O'Rourke who was once
wounded in Cuba, and later nearly died of fever
in Tampa?" he asked, when Hemming was through.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the same man," said Hemming, "and as
decent a chap as ever put foot in stirrup.  Do you
know him?"
</p>

<p>
"No, but I have heard a deal about him," replied
the lieutenant.  It did not surprise Hemming that
a man should hear about O'Rourke.  Surely the
good old chap had worked hard enough (in his own
daring, vagrant way) for his reputation.  He
brushed a mosquito away from his neck, and smoked
on in silence.
</p>

<p>
"I have heard a&mdash;a romance connected with
your friend O'Rourke," said Ellis, presently, in a
voice that faltered.  Hemming pricked up his ears
at that.
</p>

<p>
"So have I.  Tell me what you have heard," he
said.
</p>

<p>
"It is not so much what I've heard, as who I
heard it from," began the lieutenant, "and it's
rather a personal yarn.  I met a girl, not long ago,
and we seemed to take to each other from the start.
I saw her frequently, and I got broken up on her.
Then I found out that, though she liked me better
than any other fellow in sight, she did not love me
one little bit.  She admired my form at golf, and
considered my conversation edifying, but when it
came to love, why, there was some one else.  Then
she told me about O'Rourke.  She had nursed him
in Tampa for several months, just before the time
old Hudson had recaptured his fortune."
</p>

<p>
"O'Rourke told me something about it," said
Hemming.  "He thought, at the time, that he was
an invalid for life, so he did not let her know how
he felt about her.  Afterward the doctors told him
he was sound as a bell, and ever since&mdash;barring
this last Cuban business&mdash;he has been looking for
her."
</p>

<p>
"But he does not know that she loves him?"
queried Ellis.
</p>

<p>
"I really couldn't say," replied Hemming.
</p>

<p>
Ellis shifted his position, and with deft fingers
rerolled the leaf of his moist cigar.  In a dim sort
of way he wondered if he could give up the girl.
In time, perhaps, she would love him&mdash;if he could
keep O'Rourke out of sight.  A man in the little
encampment began to sing a sentimental negro
melody.  The clear, sympathetic tenor rang, like a
bugle-call, across the stagnant air.  A banjo, with
its wilful pathos, tinkled and strummed.
</p>

<p>
"Listen! that is Bolls, my sergeant.  He is a
member of the Harvard Glee Club," said the lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Hemming listened, and the sweet voice awoke the
bitter memories.  Presently he asked: "What is
Miss Hudson's address?"
</p>

<p>
"She is now in Europe, with her father," replied
his companion.  "Their home is in Marlow, New
York State."
</p>

<p>
"May I let O'Rourke know?" asked Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," replied Ellis, scarce above a
whisper.  He wondered what nasty, unsuspected devil
had sprung to power within him, keeping him from
telling that the home in Marlow was by this time
in the hands of strangers, and that the Hudsons
intended living in New York after their return from
Europe.
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke had asked Hemming to write to him
now and then, to the Army and Navy Club at
Washington, where the letters would be sure to find him
sooner or later; so Hemming wrote him the glad
information from Porto Rico.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br><br>
HEMMING DRAWS HIS BACK PAY
</h3>

<p>
Hemming walked down Broadway on the morning
of a bright November day.  The hurrying
crowds on the pavements, however weary at heart,
looked glad and eager in the sunlight.  The stir
of the wide street got into his blood, and he stepped
along with the air of one bound upon an errand that
promised more than money.  He entered a cigar
store, and filled his case with Turkish cigarettes.
Some newspapers lay on the counter, but he turned
away from them, for he was sick of news.  Further
along, he glanced into the windows of a book-shop.
His gaze alighted upon the figure of a Turkish
soldier.  Across the width of the sheet ran the magic
words, "Where Might Is Right.  A Book of the
Greco-Turkish War.  By Herbert Hemming."
</p>

<p>
As one walks in a dream, Hemming entered the
shop.  "Give me a copy of that book," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, sir?" inquired the shopman.
</p>

<p>
Hemming recovered his wits.
</p>

<p>
"I want a copy of 'Where Might Is Right,'
by Hemming," he said.  He laid aside his gloves
and stick, and opened the book with loving hands.
His first book.  The pride of it must have been very
apparent on his tanned face, for the man behind
the counter smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I have read that book myself," ventured the
man.  "I always read a book that I sell more than
twenty copies of in one day."
</p>

<p>
Hemming glowed, and continued his scrutiny of
the volume.  On one of the first pages was printed,
"Authorized American Edition."  The name of
the publishers was S&mdash;&mdash;'s Sons.
</p>

<p>
"Where do S&mdash;&mdash;'s Sons hang out?" he asked,
as he paid for the book.
</p>

<p>
"Just five doors below this," said the man.
</p>

<p>
"I'll look in there," decided Hemming, "before
I call on Dodder."
</p>

<p>
The war correspondent was cordially received by
the head of the great publishing house.  He was
given a comprehensive account of the arrangements
made between his London and New York publishers,
and these proved decidedly satisfactory.  The
business talk over, Hemming prepared to go.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you will look me up again before you
leave town," said the head of the firm, as they shook
hands.
</p>

<p>
Arrived in the outer office of the New York News
Syndicate, Hemming inquired for Mr. Dodder.
The clerk stared at him with so strange an
expression that his temper suffered.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what the devil is the matter?" he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Dodder is dead," replied the youth.  Just
then Wells came from an inner room, caught sight
of the Englishman, and approached.
</p>

<p>
"So you're back, are you?" he remarked, with
his hands in his pockets.  Hemming was thinking
of the big, kind-hearted manager, and replied by
asking the cause of his death.  "Apoplexy.  Are
you ready to sail for the Philippines?  Why didn't
you wait in Porto Rico for orders?" he snapped.
</p>

<p>
"Keep cool, my boy," said Hemming's brain to
Hemming's heart.  Hemming himself said, with
painful politeness: "I can be ready in two days,
Mr. Wells, but first we must make some new
arrangements as to expenses and salary."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think you are worth more than you
get?" sneered Wells.  "Has that book that you
wrote, when we were paying you to do work for us,
given you a swelled head?"
</p>

<p>
Hemming was about to reply when an overgrown
young man, a bookkeeper, who had been listening,
nudged his elbow roughly.
</p>

<p>
"Here's your mail," he said.
</p>

<p>
Hemming placed the half-dozen letters in his
pocket.  His face was quite pale, considering the
length of time he had been in the tropics.  He took
the overgrown youth by the front of his jacket and
shook him.  Then he twirled him deftly and pushed
him sprawling against his enraged employer.  Both
went down, swearing viciously.  The other inmates
of the great room stared and waited.  Most of them
looked pleased.  An office boy, who had received
notice to leave that morning, sprang upon a table.
"Soak it to 'em, Dook.  Soak it to 'em, you bang-up
Chawley.  Dey can't stand dat sort o' health food."
</p>

<p>
Wells got to his feet.  The bookkeeper scrambled
up and rushed at Hemming.  He was received in
a grip that made him repent his action.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Wells," said Hemming, "I shall hold on
to this gentleman, who does not seem to know how
to treat his superiors, until he cools off, and in the
meantime I'll trouble you for what money is due me,
up to date.  Please accept my resignation at the
same time."
</p>

<p>
"I'll call a copper," sputtered Wells.
</p>

<p>
The door opened, and the head of the publishing
house of S&mdash;&mdash;'s Sons entered.
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord, what is the trouble?" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"I am trying to draw my pay," explained Hemming.
</p>

<p>
The new arrival looked at the ruffled, confused
Wells with eyes of contempt and suspicion.
</p>

<p>
"I'll wait for you, Mr. Hemming, on condition
that you will lunch with me," he cried.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later they left the building, and
in his pocket Hemming carried a check for the sum
of his back pay.
</p>

<p>
"In a month from now," said his companion,
"that concern will not be worth as much as your
check is written for.  Even poor old Dodder had
all he could do to hold it together.  He had the
brains and decency, and that fellow had the money."
</p>

<p>
By the time lunch was over, Hemming found
himself once more in harness, but harness of so
easy a fit that not a buckle galled.  The billet was
a roving commission from S&mdash;&mdash;'s Sons to do articles
of unusual people and unusual places for their
illustrated weekly magazine.  He spent the
afternoon in reading and writing letters.  He advised
every one with whom he had dealings of his new
headquarters.  He had a good collection of maps,
and sat up until three in the morning pondering over
them.  Next day he bought himself a camera, and
overhauled his outfit.  By the dawn of the third
day after his separation from the syndicate, he had
decided to start northward, despite the season.
</p>

<p>
The clamour of battle was no longer his guide.
Now the Quest of the Little-Known was his.  It
brought him close to many hearths, and taught him
the hearts of all sorts and conditions of men.  In
the span of a few years, it made him familiar with
a hundred villages between Nain in the North and
Rio de Janeiro in the South.  He found comfort
under the white lights of strange cities, and sought
peace in various wildernesses.  Under the canvas
roof and the bark, as under the far-shining shelters
of the town, came ever the dream of his old life for
bedfellow.

PART TWO
</h2>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
THE UNSUSPECTED CITY
</h3>

<p>
Hemming happened upon the city of Pernamba
on the evening of a sultry day in April.  He
manifested no surprise beyond straightening his monocle
in his eye.
</p>

<p>
"Hope they have some English soda-water down
there," he said to the heavy foliage about him, "but
I suppose it would be hardly fair to expect an ice
factory so far from the coast."  For a second a
vision of tall glasses and ice that clinked came to
his mind's eye.  He remembered the cool dining-rooms
of his friends in Pernambuco.  He spurred
his native-bred steed to a hesitating trot along the
narrow, hoof-worn path that led down to the valley.
At a mud and timber hut set beneath banana-trees,
and backed by a tiny field, he drew rein.  A woman
sat before the door, looking cool and at ease in her
scanty cotton dress.  A naked child chased a pig
among the bananas.  Hemming greeted the woman
in Portuguese.  She gave him humble greeting in
return.  The pig and the baby came near to listen.
Hemming swung his feet free from the stirrups, to
straighten the kink out of his knees.  He pushed
back his pith helmet, and lit a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"What is the name of the town?" he asked, smiling
reassuringly.
</p>

<p>
The woman told him, standing respectfully on
the earthen threshold.  Such square shoulders and
clear eyes as this Englishman's were not every-day
sights in Pernamba.
</p>

<p>
"May a stranger find entertainment there?" he
inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she replied, "and the great man who owns
it is generous to strangers.  He is a big man, full
of wisdom, smoking eternally a yellow cigar not
of this country."
</p>

<p>
Hemming dismounted, the better to rest his horse.
Although he had ridden all that day and the day
before, he felt no fatigue himself.  The tropical
sun, the narrow water-cut paths, and the clambering
vines held in the heated air and luring him with
strange flowers, brought him no terror.  But he
polished his monocle and sighed uneasily, for his
store of <i>milreis</i> had dwindled since leaving Pernambuco
a week before to a sum equalling about eleven
pounds in English money.
</p>

<p>
"Has this man an army?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Truly a great army," replied the woman, "for
I have seen it myself, riding after thieves.  It
numbers five hundred men, all armed, and wearing white
tunics, and all paid for by this man.  He must be
richer than a king to support so grand an army."
</p>

<p>
Hemming smiled toward the white and red roofs
and clumps of foliage in the valley, thinking, maybe,
of his own old regiment, of Aldershot during a
review, of the hill batteries that had supported the
infantry advance in India, and of the fifty regiments
under canvas in Tampa.
</p>

<p>
"I crave a drink," he said,&mdash;"a finger of your
good casash in a bowl of cool water."
</p>

<p>
The woman brought it, smiling with hospitality,
and would not accept the ragged bill which he held
out to her.
</p>

<p>
"It is a pleasure," cried she, "to slake the thirst
of so distinguished a seÃ±or."
</p>

<p>
Hemming bowed gravely, a smile lifting his
upturned, pale moustache.  The baby came close, on
all fours, and examined his yellow riding-boots and
straight spurs.  Hemming patted the small one's
limp black hair.
</p>

<p>
"This is a kindly world," he said in English,
then to the woman: "Let thy son wear this ring,&mdash;see,
it fits his thumb.  Should any man ask the
name of his friend, say it is Hemming, an Englishman."
</p>

<p>
He pushed the child gently toward its mother,
and, swinging to his saddle, rode down toward the
city.  His gray eyes took in everything,&mdash;the yellowing
fruit, the fields of cane, the mud huts of the
poor, the thin horses of the charcoal-burners crowding
out of the trail to let him pass, and the patches
of manioc.
</p>

<p>
All this he beheld with satisfaction.  In a thin
book he made a note, thus: "Pernamba, name of
town evidently run by a governor of independent
spirit.  Army of 500, evidently mounted infantry.
Welcomed to outskirts of city by kind peasant
woman, evening of April 6, 19&mdash;.  Same climate
and crops as rest of Brazil.  Eleven pounds in my
pockets in Brazilian notes and small coin.  What
does Pernamba hold for H.H. I wonder?  A dinner
or two, perhaps, and a couple of chapters for my
book."
</p>

<p>
Presently the twisting path met a highway between
royal palms.  Good-sized villas, their walls
all blue and white with glazed tiles, their roofs dusky
red, or else flat and railed about with white stones,
each in its separate garden.  The gardens were
enclosed by high walls of brick, such as he had seen
many times in the resident sections of Pernambuco.
For months he had lived in just such a house, and
lolled in just such a garden.
</p>

<p>
"The old Dutch influence," he said, tossing his
cigarette over the nearest wall.  A bullock-cart came
creaking along the road, the patient cattle, with
heads held low and a straight yoke across their
wrinkled necks, the driver walking at their heels,
sombre with dust, and daintily puffing a cigarette.
The cart was loaded with sacks of sugar, which sent
up a heavy, sickly smell.  Hemming hailed the
driver.
</p>

<p>
"Where does the governor live, my friend?"
</p>

<p>
"The President, seÃ±or?  There behind the white
panthers."  With the stock of his rawhide whip,
the fellow pointed to an iron gate, set between posts
of red brick, topped with marble panthers.  Each
panther held a shield between its front paws.
Hemming threw the bullock-driver a coin, and rode on
the pavement, the better to examine the armorial
design on the shields.  He laughed softly.
</p>

<p>
"Familiar," he said, "ah, yes, a good enough
old Devonshire shield.  I have admired it in the
dining-room of the Governor of Newfoundland.
Now I doff my hat to it at the entrance of a
president's residence.  Dash it all, I have outgrown
dismay, and a jolly good thing, too."  He flecked a
leaf off his knee with the tip of his glove.
</p>

<p>
"Queer I never heard about this before,&mdash;and
what the deuce is a Brazilian doing with those
arms?  Can this be where that crazy American
whom old Farrington told me about hangs out?"  His
brow cleared, and he bowed to the
expressionless panthers.
</p>

<p>
A sentry, who had been standing a few paces off,
with a cavalry sabre at his shoulder and a cigarette
in his mouth, now drew near and saluted.  Hemming
returned the salute sharply.  This same custom
of smoking on sentry-go had jarred on him
many a time in Pernambuco.  He had noticed the
same thing in Bahia.
</p>

<p>
"I would see the President," he said, and passed
his card to the soldier.  From a small guard-house
just inside the wall came several more white-clad
men.  One of these hurried away with Hemming's
card, and presently returned.  The gates were swung
wide open; Hemming rode in at a dress-parade trot,
travel-stained, straight of back, his monocle flashing
in his eye.  Soldiers posted here and there among
the palms and roses and trim flower-beds stood at
attention as he passed.
</p>

<p>
He drew rein and dismounted at the foot of the
marble steps.  A tall, heavily built man, dressed in
a black frock coat and white trousers, came down to
meet him.  A man in livery took his horse.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hemming," said the large man, "I am
the President."  He popped a fat, yellow cigar into
his mouth, and shook hands.  "Come in," he said.
He led the way into a large tiled room, containing
a billiard-table of the American kind, a roll-top desk,
and an office chair.  The windows of the room were
all on one side, and opened on a corner of the
gardens, in which a fountain tossed merrily.  The
President sank into a chair in the easiest manner, and
threw one leg over the arm of it.  Then he noticed,
with a quick twinkle in his blue eyes, Hemming
in the middle of the floor, erect and unsmiling.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hemming," he said, "I want your respect,
but none of that stiff-backed ceremony between
gentlemen.  I am neither Roosevelt nor Albert Edward.
Even Morgan is a bigger man than I am, though
I still hope.  You have been in the English army,
and you like to have things starched; well, so do I
sometimes.  Please fall into that chair."
</p>

<p>
Hemming blushed and sat down.  The man was
evidently crazy.  "My name is Tetson," said the
President.  He rang the bell and a native servant
entered.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, a Scotch and soda," said Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I knew it," laughed the other, "though I
always take rye myself."
</p>

<p>
The servant bowed and retired.
</p>

<p>
"I see the illustrated weeklies of both New York
and London," continued Tetson, "and I always
look for your articles.  I like them.  I know
something about your family, also, Hemming.  I have
'Burke's Landed Gentry' and 'Who's Who' on
my desk.  You are a grandson of Sir Bertram
Hemming of Barracker."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Hemming, both surprised and embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the President, "I have some blood
in me, too.  My mother's grandmother was a
Gostwycke.  Did you notice the three stars and six
choughs?"
</p>

<p>
"I know the head of your house at home, Colonel
Bruce-Gostwycke, and another distinguished member
of it in the colonies, Sir Henry Renton," replied
Hemming.  "But," he continued, briskly, twisting
his moustache, "you are something bigger than
that here.  Why do you hold this little half-dead
county family so high?"
</p>

<p>
"My mother in New York taught me to," replied
Tetson, "and then this business is different.
I did it, as you Englishmen say, off my own bat.
A pile of money, a lot of gall, a little knowledge of
the weakness of men in office,&mdash;this is all about
it.  Even now most of my friends think me a fool."  He
gravely relit his yellow cigar.  The reek of
it was worse than jerked beef to Hemming.  "I
will tell you my story some day, but now you want
a shower-bath and a change.  Please consider
yourself at home.  Sudden friendships may not be good
form in England, but they are all right back here."
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said Hemming, "I have brushed about
a bit; I'm not such a&mdash;so English as I look."
</p>

<p>
Tetson turned to the servant: "Tell Smith to
look after Mr. Hemming.  Smith is a handy man.
You will find all kinds of cigarettes in his keeping,
and we shall dine at eight.  If you feel hungry in
the meantime, tell Smith."
</p>

<p>
He arose and shook hands.  Hemming followed
the servant, inwardly wondering, outwardly calm.
He had met many strange people in his adventurous
life, and had become accustomed to luck of every
kind, but this big President, with the yellow cigar,
was beyond anything he had ever dreamed.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad I was born with imagination, and
have enjoyed the enlightening society of O'Rourke
in so many strange places," he thought.
</p>

<p>
Smith proved to be a clean-shaven man, all in
white and brass buttons.  Hemming surveyed him
with interest.
</p>

<p>
"I see that you are an Englishman, Smith," he
said.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," replied Smith, in faultless tones.  "I
was born on the Bowery.  But I have been in
London, sir, yes, sir, with Mr. Tetson.  We haven't
always lived in this 'ere 'ole."
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Hemming that the h's had been
dropped with a certain amount of effort on the
man's part, and that his eyes twinkled in a quite
uncalled-for way.  But it did not bother him now.
Even a valet may be allowed his joke.
</p>

<p>
Soon he was enjoying the luxury of a shower-bath
in a great, cool room, standing by itself in a
vineyard and rose garden.  The shower fell about
six feet before it touched his head.  The roof of the
building was open to the peak, and a subdued light,
leaf-filtered, came down through a glass tile set
in among the earthen ones.  The walls and floor
were of white and blue tiles.  The bath was of
marble, as large as an English billiard-table, and
not unlike the shallow basin of a fountain.
</p>

<p>
Cool and vigorous, Hemming stepped from the
bath, replaced his eye-glass, and lit a cigarette.
Swathed in a white robe, with his feet in native
slippers, he unlocked the door and issued into the
scented garden air.  Smith awaited him in the
vine-covered alley, holding a "swizzle" on a silver tray.
He drained the glass, and, lifting up the hem of his
robe, followed the valet back to the dressing-room.
Chameleons darted across his path, and through
the palms floated the ringing notes of a bugle-call.
</p>

<p>
"I found your razors and your brushes in the
saddle-bags," announced Smith, "and these shirts,
sir, I bought, guessing at your size, and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What is this?" interrupted Hemming, holding
aloft a white jacket heavy with gold.
</p>

<p>
"Mess jacket of our regiment, sir.  The President
would feel honoured if you would wear it.
And these trousers were sent in by one of the native
officers, with his compliments," replied the valet.
</p>

<p>
Hemming curtly intimated his readiness to dress.
Smith closed the shutters, turned on the lights, and
examined a couple of razors.
</p>

<p>
Twenty minutes later, Herbert Hemming, in the
mess uniform of a colonel in the President of
Pernamba's army, was ushered into the presence of the
family, and a certain Mr. Valentine Hicks.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
THE SPORTING PRESIDENT
</h3>

<p>
The President's name was Harris William Tetson.
His wife had been Mary Appleton, born of
cultured parents in Philadelphia.  She welcomed
Hemming in the most friendly manner.  The third
member of the family was a tall girl, with a soft
voice and an English accent.  She shook hands
with Hemming, and he noticed that the pressure of
her hand was firm and steady, like that of a man's.
She wore glasses.  The light from the shaded
candles glowed warm on her white neck and arms.
Hemming had not expected to find any one like this
in the interior of South America.  He used to know
girls like her at home, and one in particular flashed
into his memory with a pang of bitterness.  In his
agitation, he almost overlooked the extended hand
of Mr. Valentine Hicks.
</p>

<p>
The dinner was of great length.  A few of the
dishes were American, but most were of the country.
Two dusky servants waited upon the diners.  The
claret was to Hemming's taste, and, as he listened
to Miss Tetson describe an incident of her
morning's ride, a feeling of rest and homeliness came
to him.  A little wind stole in from the roses and
fountains, and the man of wars and letters, great
dreams and unsung actions, saw, with wondering
eyes, that it loosened a red petal from the roses at
her shoulder and dropped it upon her white arm.
He looked up sharply, and only the light of genial
friendship remained in the eyes that met those of
Valentine Hicks.  But Hicks looked sulky;
understanding came to the heart of Hemming.  At last
the dinner came to an end, and Tetson dropped the
subject of freight on sugar, and took up the lighter
one of real estate.  Coffee was brought; no one
listened to Tetson, but he prosed on, his good-natured
face turned toward the shadows in the ceiling,
a yellow cigar stuck jauntily in his mouth.
Hemming was busy with his own thoughts, wondering
into what nest of lunatics his free-lancing had
brought him.  He longed for O'Rourke's help.  The
girl drew something from her bodice, and laid it
before him.  It was a cigarette-case.
</p>

<p>
"You may take one, if you do not bore us by
looking shocked," she said.
</p>

<p>
Hemming drew forth a cigarette, and lit it at the
nearest candle.  "As to being shocked," he replied,
"why, I used to know a girl who&mdash;" he stopped
suddenly and glanced down at his coffee.  "Of
course it is quite the thing now," he added, in stilted
tones.
</p>

<p>
Hicks refused a cigarette from the silver case,
and moodily puffed at a black native cigar.
Mrs. Tetson did not smoke, but entertained the others
with a description of her first and only attempt at
the recreation.
</p>

<p>
The little wind died away.  Outside, the fountain
splashed sleepily.  The blood-red petal fell from
the girl's arm to the whiter cloth.  A flame-bewildered
moth bungled into the President's coffee.
Hemming's workaday brain was lulled to repose,
and now he was only Hemming the poet.  He looked
into the eyes across the table.  But he had lived
so long with men, and the foolish, evident affairs
of generals and statesmen, that Miss Tetson's
glances were as weapons for which he knew no
manual of defence.  They touched him more than
he liked, awaking in his hitherto disciplined
memory a hundred fibres of broken dreams.  And every
fibre tingled like a nerve with a sweetness sharp
as pain,&mdash;and time swung back, and all the healing
of his long exile was undone.
</p>

<p>
When the ladies rose from the table, Mr. Tetson
came over to Hemming and nudged him confidentially.
He looked very sly.  "What d'ye say to a
game of billiards?" he whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Delighted," murmured Hemming, relieved that
his strange host had not suggested something worse.
</p>

<p>
"I like the game," continued Tetson, "but as
Hicks is a damn fool at it, I don't indulge very
often.  Hicks is too young, anyway,&mdash;a nice fellow,
but altogether too young for men to associate
with.  Trotting 'round with the girls is more in
his line."
</p>

<p>
"Really," remarked the newcomer, uneasily.  He
was not quite sure whether or not Hicks had got
out of ear-shot.
</p>

<p>
"Fact," said the President,&mdash;"cold truth.
Marion can't play, either.  I've had Santosa up
several times for a game, but he's too dashed
respectful to beat me.  You'll not be that way,
Hemming?"
</p>

<p>
"I should hope not," replied Hemming, absently,
his eyes still turned toward the door through which
the rest of the party had vanished.
</p>

<p>
"What d'ye say to five dollars the game?"
Tetson whispered.  The adventurer's heart sank, but
he followed his host to the billiard-room with an
unconcerned air.  They played until past midnight,
the President in his shirt-sleeves, with the yellow
cigar smouldering always.  A servant marked for
them, and another uncorked the soda-water.  After
the last shot had been made, Valentine Hicks strolled
in, with his hands in his pockets and his brow
clouded.
</p>

<p>
"Did the old man do you?" he inquired of Hemming.
</p>

<p>
The free-lance shook his head.  "I took ten
pounds away from him," he said.
</p>

<p>
The secretary whistled.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0203"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
THE POST OF HONOUR.&mdash;THE SECRETARY'S AFFAIR
</h3>

<p>
Hemming awoke with a clear head, despite the
President's whiskey, and remembered, with
satisfaction, the extra ten pounds.  His windows were
wide open, and a cool dawn wind came in across
the gardens.  He threw aside the sheet and went
over to the middle window, and, finding that the
ledge extended to form a narrow balcony, stepped
outside.  Away to the right, he could mark a bend
of the river by the low-lying mist.  He sniffed the
air.  "There is fever in it," he said, and wondered
how many kinds of a fool Mr. Tetson was.  He
was sorry for the ladies.  They did not look like
the kind of people to enjoy being shut away from
the world in such a God-forsaken hole as this.  Why
didn't the old ass start a town on the coast? he
asked himself.  While engaged in these puzzling
reflections, Smith rapped at the door, and entered.
He carried coffee, a few slices of dry toast, and a
jug of shaving-water.
</p>

<p>
"Will you ride this morning, sir?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes," replied Hemming, and said he
would be shaved before drinking his coffee.  As
the valet lathered his chin, he asked if the
President rode every morning.
</p>

<p>
"Not 'e, sir," replied the man, "but Miss Tetson
does, and Mr. 'Icks."
</p>

<p>
Hemming found his well-worn riding-breeches
brushed and folded, his boots and spurs shining
like the sun, and a new cotton tunic ready for him.
He looked his surprise at sight of the last article.
</p>

<p>
"You didn't give me any order, sir," explained
the man, "but, bein' as I'm a bit of a tilor myself,
I thought as 'ow you wouldn't mind&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Hemming interrupted him with uplifted hand.
</p>

<p>
"It was very kind of you," he said, "and I am
sure it is an excellent fit.  See if you can't find a
sovereign among that change on the table."
</p>

<p>
As he rode through the great gates, Hemming
caught sight of Miss Tetson along the road.  At
sound of his horse's hoofs, she turned in her saddle
and waved her hand.  He touched his little white
stallion into that renowned sliding run that had
made it famous in Pernambuco.  They rode together
for over an hour.  Hicks did not turn out
that morning.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Valentine Hicks was young, and an
American.  Though he had been born in Boston, he lacked
something in breeding,&mdash;a very shadowy something
that would correct itself as life took him in
hand.  Though he had been an undergraduate of
Harvard University for two years, he displayed to
Hemming's mind a childish ignorance of men and
books.  No doubt he had practised the arts of
drop-kicking and tackling with distinction, for he
was big and well muscled.  He was distantly
connected with the Tetsons, and had joined them in
Pernamba soon after their arrival in the country,
and two years previous to the opening of this
narrative, to act as Tetson's private secretary.  At
first Mr. Hicks looked with suspicion upon the
wandering Englishman.  He was in an unsettled frame
of mind at the time, poor fellow.  He saw in
Hemming a dangerous rival to his own monopoly of
Miss Tetson.  Already the lady was talking about
some sort of book the duffer had written.
</p>

<p>
A few days after Hemming's arrival, the army,
to the number of four hundred rank and file and
twenty-six officers, was drawn up for the President's
inspection.  Hemming rode with Tetson, and the
little brown soldiers wondered at the frosty glitter
of his eye-glass.  His mount was the same upon
which he had entered the country,&mdash;a white, native-bred
stallion, the gift of one McPhey, a merchant
in Pernambuco.  Miss Tetson and Hicks, each followed
by a groom, trotted aimlessly about the waiting
ranks, much to Hemming's disgust.  Tetson
lit the inevitable yellow weed.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think of them?" he asked, waving
his hand toward the troops.
</p>

<p>
"They look to me as if they were stuffed with
bran," answered the Englishman, "and their
formation is all wrong."
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said Tetson, sadly crestfallen.
</p>

<p>
Presently he touched Hemming's knee.
</p>

<p>
"If you will take them in hand,&mdash;the whole
lopsided consignment, from the muddy-faced colonel
down,&mdash;why, I'll be your everlasting friend,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
Hemming stared at them, pondering.
</p>

<p>
"It will mean enemies for me," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"No, I can answer for everything but their drill,"
said the other.
</p>

<p>
Hemming saluted, and, wheeling the white
stallion, rode alone up and down the uneven ranks.
His face was set in severe lines, but behind the mask
lurked mirth and derision at the pettiness of his
high-styled office.
</p>

<p>
"Commander-in-chief," he said, and, putting his
mount to a canter, completely circled his command
in a fraction of a minute.
</p>

<p>
"I shall begin to lick them into shape to-morrow,"
he said to Tetson.
</p>

<p>
The little officers, clanging their big cavalry
sabres, marched their little brown troops away to
the barracks.  The President looked wistfully after
them, and said: "I can mount three hundred of
them, Hemming.  I call it a pretty good army, for
all its lack of style."
</p>

<p>
"I call it half a battalion of duffers," said
Hemming to himself.
</p>

<p>
Later, the new commander-in-chief and the private
secretary sat together in the former's quarters.
</p>

<p>
"I do not quite understand this Pernamba idea,"
said Hemming.  "Is it business, or is it just an
unusual way of spending money?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what the old man is driving at
myself," replied Hicks, "but of one thing I am sure:
there's more money put into it than there is in it.
The army is a pretty expensive toy, for instance.
Just what it is for I do not know.  The only job
it ever tried was collecting rents, and it made a
mess of that.  We don't sell enough coffee in a year
to stand those duffers a month's pay.  We get
skinned right and left back here and down on the
coast.  Mr. Tetson thinks he still possesses a clear
business head, but the fact is he cannot understand
his own bookkeeping.  It's no fun running a
hundred-square-mile ranch, with a fair-sized town
thrown in."
</p>

<p>
Hemming wrinkled his forehead, and stared vacantly
out of the window.  Below him a gray parrot,
the property of Miss Tetson, squawked in an
orange-tree.
</p>

<p>
"If I had money, I should certainly live somewhere
else.  Why the devil he keeps his wife and
daughter here, I don't see."
</p>

<p>
Just then the secretary caught the faint strumming
of a banjo, and left hurriedly, without venturing
an explanation.  He found Miss Tetson in her
favourite corner of the garden, where roses grew
thickest, and breadfruit-trees made a canopy of
green shade.  A fountain splashed softly beside
the stone bench whereon she sat, and near by stood
a little brown crane watching the water with eyes
like yellow jewels.
</p>

<p>
The girl had changed from her riding-habit into
a white gown, such as she wore almost every day.
But now Hicks saw her with new eyes.  She seemed
to him more beautiful than he had dreamed a
woman could be.  Yesterday he had thought, in
his indolent way, that he loved her.  Now he knew
it, and his heart seemed to leap and pause in a mad
sort of fear.  The look of well-fed satisfaction
passed away from him.  He stood there between the
roses like a fool,&mdash;he who had come down to the
garden so carelessly, with some jest on his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Something will happen now," she said, and
smiled up at him.  Hicks wondered what she meant.
</p>

<p>
"It is too hot to have anything happen," he
replied.
</p>

<p>
"That is the matter with us,&mdash;it is too hot,
always too hot, and we are too tired," she said,
"but Mr. Hemming does not seem to mind the heat.
I think that something interesting will happen now."
</p>

<p>
This was like a knife in the man's heart, for he
was learning to like the Englishman.
</p>

<p>
The girl looked at the little crane by the fountain.
Hicks stood for a moment, trying to smile.  But
it was hard work to look as if he did not care.
"Lord, what an ass I have been," he said to himself,
but aloud he stammered something about their rides
together, and their friendship.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you can ride very well," she laughed,
"but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She did not finish the remark, and the secretary,
after a painful scrutiny of the silent banjo in her
lap, went away to the stables and ordered his horse.
But a man is a fool to ride hard along the bank
of a Brazilian river in the heat of the afternoon.
</p>

<p>
From one of the windows of his cool room, Hemming
watched the departure of the President's
private secretary.  He remembered what Tetson had
said of the boy,&mdash;"too young to associate with
men."
</p>

<p>
But youth is a thing easily mended, thought
Hemming.  Somehow&mdash;perhaps only in size&mdash;Hicks
recalled O'Rourke to his mind; and back to
him came the days of their good-comradeship.  He
wondered where O'Rourke was now, and what he
was busy about.  He had seen him last in Labrador,
where they had spent a month together, salmon
fishing, and up to that time O'Rourke had found
no trace of Miss Hudson.  Ellis's information had
proved useless.  Disgusted at the deception
practised upon him, the poor fellow had ceased to speak
of the matter, even with his dearest friend during
night-watches by the camp-fire.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
THE THING THAT HAPPENED
</h3>

<p>
Hicks came along the homeward road at dusk.
Lights were glowing above the strong walls and
behind the straight trunks of the palms.  A mist
that one might smell lay along the course of the
river.  Hicks rode heavily and with the air of one
utterly oblivious to his surroundings.  But at the
gateway of the officers' mess he looked up.  Captain
Santosa was in the garden, a vision of white
and gold and dazzling smile.  He hurried to the
gate.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, my dear Hicks, you are in time for our
small cocktails, and then dinner.  But for this riding
so hard, I can call you nothing but a fool."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks very much," replied the American,
dismounting slowly, "and as to what you call me,
old man, I'm not at all particular."  The
woebegone expression of his plump face was almost
ludicrous.
</p>

<p>
Santosa whistled, and presently an orderly came
and took Valentine's horse.  The two entered the
building arm in arm, and the secretary swayed as
he walked.
</p>

<p>
Five or six of the native officers were already in
the mess-room, swallowing mild swizzles, and talking
quietly.  They greeted Hicks affectionately.
</p>

<p>
"This man," said Santosa, "had his horse looking
like a shaving-brush, and I know nothing in
English so suitable to call him as this," and he
swore vigorously in Portuguese.
</p>

<p>
"Stow that rot," said Hicks, "can't you see I'm
fit as a fiddle; and for Heaven's sake move some
liquor my way, will you?"  His request was speedily
complied with, and he helped himself recklessly
from the big decanter.
</p>

<p>
The dinner was long and hot, and Valentine
Hicks, forgetting utterly his Harvard manner,
dropped his head on the table, between his claret-glass
and coffee-cup, and dreamed beastly dreams.
The swarthy Brazilians talked and smoked, and
sent away the decanters to be refilled.  The stifling
air held the tobacco smoke above the table.  The
cotton-clad servants moved on noiseless feet.
</p>

<p>
"These Americans,&mdash;dear heaven," spoke a fat
major, softly.
</p>

<p>
"I am fond of Hicks," said Santosa, laying his
hand on the youth's unconscious shoulder.  A
slim lieutenant, who had held a commission in a
Brazilian regiment stationed in Rio, looked at the
captain.
</p>

<p>
"The Americans are harmless," he said.  "They
mind their own business,&mdash;or better still, they let
us mind it for them.  The President&mdash;bah!  And
our dear Valentine.  If he gets enough to eat, and
clothes cut in the English way, and some one to
listen to his little stories of how he used to play
golf at Harvard, he is content.  But this
Englishman,&mdash;this SeÃ±or Hemming,&mdash;he is quite
different."
</p>

<p>
"Did not you at one time play golf?" asked
Santosa, calmly.
</p>

<p>
"Three times, in Florida," replied the lieutenant,
"and with me played a lady, who talked at her
ease and broke two clubs in one morning.  She was
of a fashionable convent named Smith, but this did
not deter her from the free expression of her
thoughts."
</p>

<p>
"Stir up SeÃ±or Hicks, that we may hear two
fools at the same time," said the colonel.
</p>

<p>
"Take my word for it, colonel, that Valentine
is not a fool," said Santosa, lightly.  "He is very
young."
</p>

<p>
"Have you nothing to say for me?" asked the
slim lieutenant, good-naturedly.
</p>

<p>
"You know what I think of you all," replied
Santosa, without heat.  The conversation was
carried on in Portuguese, and now ran into angry
surmises as to the President's reason for placing
Hemming in command.
</p>

<p>
It was close upon midnight when Hicks awoke.
He straightened himself in his chair and blinked
at Santosa, who alone, of the whole mess, remained
at table.
</p>

<p>
"You have had a little nap," said the Brazilian.
</p>

<p>
Hicks looked at him for awhile in silence.  Then
he got to his feet, and leaned heavily on the table.
</p>

<p>
"I'll walk home, old tea-cosey.  Tell your nigger
to give my gee something to eat, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"You do not look well, my dear Valentine.  You
had better stay here until morning," said Santosa.
</p>

<p>
Hicks swore, and then begged the other's pardon.
</p>

<p>
"Am I drunk, old chap?  Do I look that way?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
Captain Santosa laughed.  "You look like a man
with a grudge against some one," he answered.
"Perhaps you have a touch of fever, otherwise I
know you would have good taste enough to conceal
the grudge.  A gentleman suffers&mdash;and smiles."
</p>

<p>
It was past two o'clock in the morning, and
Hemming was lying flat on his back, smoking a
cigarette in the dark.  He had been writing verses,
and letters which he did not intend to mail, until
long past midnight.  And now he lay wide-eyed
on his bed, kept awake by the restless play of his
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
His windows were all open, and he could hear a
stirring of wind in the crests of the taller trees.
His reveries were disturbed by a stumbling of feet
in the room beyond, and suddenly Valentine Hicks
stood in the doorway.  By the faint light
Hemming made out the big, drooping shoulders and
the attitude of weariness.  He sat up quickly, and
pushed his feet into slippers.
</p>

<p>
"That you, Hicks?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk to me, you damn traitor!" said Hicks.
</p>

<p>
Hemming frowned, and tossed his cigarette into
the night.
</p>

<p>
"If you will be so good as to turn on the light,
I'll get the quinine," he said.
</p>

<p>
The secretary laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Quinine!" he cried; "you fool!  I believe an
Englishman would recommend some blasted medicine
to a man in hell."
</p>

<p>
"You're not there yet," replied Hemming.  He
was bending over an open drawer of his desk,
feeling about among papers and bottles for the box
of pills.  Hicks drew something from his pocket
and laid it softly on the table.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning," he said.  "I intended to kick
up a row but I've changed my mind.  Hand over
your pills and I'll go to bed."
</p>

<p>
When he awoke next day, it was only to a foolish
delirium.  The doctor looked at him, and then at
Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you can give it a name," he said.
</p>

<p>
Hemming nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I've had it myself," he replied.
</p>

<p>
The President, followed by his daughter, came
into the room.  Hicks recognized the girl.
</p>

<p>
"Marion," he said, and when she bent over him,
"something has happened after all."
</p>

<p>
She looked up at Hemming with a colourless face.
Her eyes were brave enough, but the pitiful expression
of her mouth touched him with a sudden painful
remembrance.  During the hours of daylight
the doctor and Miss Tetson watched by the bedside,
moving silently and speaking in whispers in the
darkened room.
</p>

<p>
The doctor was an Englishman somewhat beyond
middle age, with a past well buried.  In the streets
and on the trail his manner was short almost to
rudeness.  He often spoke bitterly and lightly of
those things which most men love and respect.  In
the sick-room, be it in the rich man's villa or in
the mud hut of the plantation labourer, he spoke
softly, and his hands were gentle as a woman's.
</p>

<p>
Hemming had been working with his little army
all day, and, after dining at the mess, he changed
and relieved Miss Tetson and the doctor.  Before
leaving the room, the girl turned to him nervously.
</p>

<p>
"Did you see Valentine last night?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
Hemming told her that Hicks had come to his
room for quinine.
</p>

<p>
"Good night, and please take good care of him,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
The Englishman screwed his eye-glass into place,
and glared at her uneasily.  "Hicks is a good sort,"
he said, "but he is not the kind for this country.
Neither are you, Miss Tetson.  But it's nuts for
me,&mdash;this playing soldier at another man's expense."
</p>

<p>
He paused, and she waited, a little impatiently,
for him to go on.  "What I wanted to say," he
continued, "is that there is one thing that goes
harder with a man than yellow fever.  I&mdash;ah&mdash;have
experienced both.  Hicks is a decent chap,"
he concluded, lamely.
</p>

<p>
Miss Tetson smiled and held out her hand.
</p>

<p>
"If he should want me in the night, please call
me.  I will not be asleep," she said.
</p>

<p>
Hemming, for all his rolling, had gathered a good
deal of moss in the shape of handiness and
out-of-the-way knowledge.  Twice during the night he
bathed the sick man; with ice and alcohol.  Many
times he lifted the burning head and held water
to the hot lips.  Sometimes he talked to him, very
low, of the North and the blue sea, and thus brought
sleep back to the glowing eyes.  The windows were
open and the blinds up, and a white moon walked
above the gardens.
</p>

<p>
Just before dawn, Hemming dozed for a few
minutes in his chair.  He was awakened by some
movement, and, opening his eyes, beheld Miss Tetson
at the bedside.  Hicks was sleeping, with his
tired face turned toward the window.  The girl
touched his forehead tenderly with her lips.
</p>

<p>
Hemming closed his eyes again, and kept them so
until he heard her leave the room,&mdash;a few light
footsteps and a soft trailing of skirts.  Then, in his
turn, he bent above the sleeper.
</p>

<p>
"If this takes you off, old chap, perhaps it will
be better," he said.
</p>

<p>
But in his inmost soul he did not believe this
bitter distrust of women that his own brain had
built up for him out of memory and weariness.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
CHANCE IN PERNAMBUCO
</h3>

<p>
While Hicks tossed about in his fever dreams,
and Hemming shook his command into form, away
on the coast, in the city of Pernambuco, unusual
things were shaping.  From the south, coastwise
from Bahia, came Bertram St. Ives O'Rourke.  This
was chance, pure and simple, for he had no idea of
Hemming's whereabouts.  From New York, on the
mail-steamer, came a man called Cuddlehead, and
took up his abode in a narrow hotel near the
waterfront.  He arrived in the city only an hour behind
O'Rourke.  He was artfully attired in yachting
garb, and had been king-passenger on the boat,
where his English accent had been greatly admired,
and his predilection for card-playing had been
bountifully rewarded.  In fact, when he went ashore with
his meagre baggage, he left behind at least one
mourning maiden heart and three empty pockets.
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke, upon landing, had his box and three
leather bags carried across the square to the
ship-chandler's.  He would look about before engaging
a room, and see if the place contained enough local
colour to pay for a stop-over.  He fell, straightway,
into easy and polite conversation with the owner
of the store.  From the busy pavement and dirty
square outside arose odours that were not altogether
foreign to his cosmopolitan nose.  Three men greeted
one another, and did business in English and
Portuguese, speaking of the cane crop, the rate of
exchange, the price of Newfoundland "fish," and of
gales met with at sea.  Bullock-carts creaked past
in the aching sunlight, the mild-eyed beasts staggering
with lowered heads.  Soldiers in uncomfortable
uniforms lounged about.  Cripples exhibited their
ugly misfortunes, and beggars made noisy supplication.
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke decided that there was enough local
colour to keep him, and, turning from the open door,
contemplated the interior of the establishment.  The
place was dim and cool, and at the far back of it
another door stood open, on a narrow cross-street.
Cases of liquor, tobacco, tea, coffee, and condensed
milk were piled high against the wall.  Baskets of
sweet potatoes and hens' eggs stood about.  Upon
shelves behind the counter samples of rope, canvas,
and cotton cloth were exhibited.  Highly coloured
posters, advertising Scotch whiskey, brightened the
gloom.  The back part of the shop was furnished
with a bar and two long tables.  At one of the tables
sat about a dozen men, each with a glass before him,
and all laughing, talking, swearing, and yet keeping
their eyes attentively fixed on one of their number,
who shook a dice-box.
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke, who had by this time made his name
known to the ship-chandler, was given a general
introduction to the dice-throwers.  He called for a
lime-squash, and took a seat at the table between a
dissipated-looking individual whom all addressed
by the title of "Major," and a master-mariner from
the North.  There were several of these shellback
skippers at table, and O'Rourke spotted them
easily enough, though, to the uninitiated, they had
nothing in common but their weather-beaten faces.
Their manners were of various degrees, running
from the height of civility around to nothing at all.
There was the first officer of a Liverpool "tramp"
with his elbows on the board, his gin-and-bitters
slopped about, and his voice high in argument.  Next
him sat a mariner from one of the Fundy ports,
nodding and starting, and trying to bury in whiskey
remembrance of his damaged cargo and unseaworthy
ship.  Nearer sat a Devonshire man in the
Newfoundland trade, drinking his sweetened claret with
all the graces of a curate, and talking with the
polish and conviction of a retired banker.  O'Rourke
glanced up and down the table, and detected one
more sailor&mdash;a quiet young man clad in white duck,
with "Royal Naval Reserve" marked upon him for
the knowing to see.  These four men (each one so
unlike the other three in clothes, appearance, and
behaviour) all wore the light of wide waters in their
eyes, the peace bred of long night-watches on their
tanned brows, and the right to command on chin
and jaw.  O'Rourke felt his heart warm toward
them, for he, too, had kept vigil beside the ghostly
mizzen, and read the compass by the uncertain torch
of the lightning.
</p>

<p>
The other occupants of the table were residents
of the country&mdash;two English planters, the major,
a commission-merchant, a native cavalry officer, and
several operators of the South American Cable
Company.  The major remarked upon the rotten state of
the country to O'Rourke, in a confidential whisper, as
he shook the dice in the leather cylinder.  O'Rourke
replied, politely, that he wasn't an authority.
</p>

<p>
"But I am, sir," blustered the major.  "Dear
heaven, man, I'd like to know who has been American
consul in this hole for the last seven years, only
to get chucked out last May by a low plebeian
politician."
</p>

<p>
The speaker's eyes were fierce, though watery, and
his face was red as the sun through smoke.  He
drained his glass, and glared at O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't say.  Never was here before," replied
O'Rourke.  He counted his neighbour's throw aloud,
for the benefit of the table.
</p>

<p>
"Three aces, a six, and a five."
</p>

<p>
He was about to recover two of the dice from a
shallow puddle on the table, and replace them in
the box, when he felt a hand on his arm.
</p>

<p>
"I was American consul," hissed the major, "and,
by hell, I'm still sober enough to count my own dice,
and pick 'em up, too."
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke smiled, unruffled.  "You don't mean
you are sober enough, major&mdash;you mean you are
not quite too drunk," he said.  The others paused
in their talk, and laughed.  The major opened his
eyes a trifle wider and dropped his under jaw.  He
looked the young stranger up and down.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I hope you are ashamed of yourself," he
said, at last.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry I was rude, sir," explained O'Rourke,
"but I hate to be grabbed by the arm that way.  I
must have a nerve there that connects with my temper."
</p>

<p>
A tipsy smile spread over the ex-consul's face.
</p>

<p>
"Shake hands, my boy," he cried.  They shook
hands.  The others craned their necks to see.
</p>

<p>
"You've come just in time to cheer me up, for
I've been lonely since Hemming went into the bush,"
exclaimed the major.
</p>

<p>
"Hemming!  Do you mean Herbert Hemming?"
asked O'Rourke, eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"That's who I mean," replied the major, and
pushed the dice-box toward him.  O'Rourke made
nothing better than a pair, and had to pay for thirteen
drinks.  If you crave a lime-squash of an afternoon,
the above method is not always the cheapest
way of acquiring it.  As the dice-box went the
rounds again, and the attention of the company
returned to generalities, the newcomer asked more
particulars of Hemming's whereabouts.
</p>

<p>
"He started into the bush more than a week ago,
to find some new kind of adventure and study the
interior, he said," explained the major, "but my
own opinion is that he went to see old Tetson in his
place up the Plado.  Sly boy, Hemming!  Whenever
we spoke of that crazy Tetson, and his daughter,
and his money, he pretended not to take any stock
in them.  But I'll eat my hat&mdash;and it's the only
one I have&mdash;if he isn't there at this minute, flashing
that precious gig-lamp of his at the young lady."
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke had read stories about this eccentric
millionaire in the newspapers some years before.
</p>

<p>
"Hemming is safe, wherever he lands," he said.
"He's a woman-hater."
</p>

<p>
A look of half-whimsical disgust flashed across
the old man's perspiring face.  He leaned close to
O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
"Bah&mdash;you make me sick," he cried, "with your
silly commonplaces.  Woman-hater&mdash;bah&mdash;any
fool, any schoolboy can say that.  Call a man an
ice-riding pinapede, and you'll display the virtue of
originality, at least.  At first I suspected you of
brains."
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke was embarrassed.  How could he explain
that, in using the term woman-hater, he had
meant to suit his conversation to the intellect of his
hearer.  It was commonplace, without doubt, and
meant nothing at all.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think, Mr. O'Rourke," continued the
other, "that simply because I'm stranded in this hole,
on my beam-ends (to use the language of our
worthy table-mates), that my brain is past being
offended?  You are wrong, then, my boy, just as
sure as my name is Farrington.  Hemming would
never have called a man a woman-hater.  Why, here
am I, sir, sitting as I have sat every day for years,
getting drunk, and with never a word to a woman,
white or black, for about as long as you have used
a razor.  But I don't hate women&mdash;-not I.  I'd
give my life, such as it is, any minute, for the first
woman who would look at me without curling her
lip&mdash;that is, the first well-bred white woman.  Ask
Hemming what he thinks, and he will tell you that,
in spite of the men, women are still the finest
creatures God ever invented.  No doubt he seems
indifferent now, but that's because he has loved some
girl very much, and has been hurt by her."
</p>

<p>
"You are right, major, and I gladly confess I
used a dashed stupid expression&mdash;so now, if you
don't mind, please shut up about it," replied
O'Rourke.  To his surprise Farrington smiled,
nodded in a knowing way, and lapsed into silence.
</p>

<p>
While one of the mariners was relating a fearsome
experience of his own on a wrecked schooner,
Mr. Cuddlehead entered the place and seated himself
at the unoccupied table.  He sipped his peg, and
studied the men at the other table with shifting
glances.  He thought they looked easy, and a vastly
satisfied expression came to his unhealthy, old-young
face.  Though well groomed and well clothed,
Mr. Cuddlehead's deportment suggested, however
vaguely, a feeling on his part of personal insecurity.
He glanced apprehensively whenever a voice was
raised high in argument.  He started in his chair
when the man who served the refreshments came
unexpectedly to his table to deposit a match-holder.
</p>

<p>
To O'Rourke, who had an eye for things beyond
the dice, Mr. Cuddlehead's face hinted at some
strange ways of life, and undesirable traits of
character.  In the loose mouth he saw signs of a once
colossal impudence; in the bloated cheeks, dissipation
and the wrecking existence of one who feasts
to-day and starves to-morrow; in the eyes cruelty
and cunning; in the chin and forehead a low sort
of courage.
</p>

<p>
Gradually the crowd at the long table thinned.
First of all the cavalry officer arose, flicked
imaginary dust off the front of his baggy trousers, and
jangled out into the reddening sunlight.  The
planters followed, after hearty farewells.  They had
long rides ahead of them to occupy the cool of the
evening, and perhaps would not leave their isolated
bungalows again inside a fortnight.  Next the
operators announced their intentions of deserting the
giddy scene.
</p>

<p>
"Come along, major, you and Joyce promised
to feed with us to-night," said one of them, "and
if your friend there, Mr. O'Rourke, will overlook
the informality of so sudden an invitation," he
continued, "we'll be delighted to have him, too."
</p>

<p>
"Great heavens, Darlington," exclaimed the
major, "you are still as long-winded as when you
first came out," and, before O'Rourke could accept
the invitation for himself, he concluded, "of course
O'Rourke will honour you, my boy."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, very much, it's awfully good of you
chaps," stammered O'Rourke, disconcerted by the
major's offhand manner.
</p>

<p>
Darlington smiled reassuringly.  "Don't let this
old cock rattle you," he said, and patted Major
Farrington affectionately on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
After dinner that night, in the palatial dining-room
of the house occupied by the staff of the South
American Cable Company, O'Rourke learned something
of the major's past life.  It was a sad and
unedifying story.  The major had been trained at
West Point, and led his class in scholarship and
drill, and had risen, with more than one distinction,
to the rank of major.  But all the while he had made
his fight against drink, as well as the usual handicaps
in the game of life.  He had married a woman with
wealth and position superior to his own, who had
admired him for his soldierly qualities and fine
appearance, and who, later, had been the first to desert
him.  Then followed the foreign consular appointments,
the bitter and ever-increasing debaucheries,
and at last the forced retirement from his country's
service.  Now he lived on a small allowance, sent
him weekly, by his family.  O'Rourke began to
understand the old man's fretful and disconcerting
moods.
</p>

<p>
At a late hour the superintendent of the staff
ushered O'Rourke to a big, cool room on the second
floor.
</p>

<p>
"Make this your home," he said, "and we'll let
you in on the same footing as ourselves.  Hemming
occupied this room last.  There is his bed; there
is his hammock; and, by Jove, there are his slippers.
You can have your traps brought up in the morning."
</p>

<p>
Thus did Bertram St. Ives O'Rourke become an
inmate of an imposing mansion in Pernambuco, with
moderate charges to pay and good company to
enliven his hours.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
CUDDLEHEAD DECIDES ON AN ADVENTURE
</h3>

<p>
Toward noon of a stifling day, the major and
Mr. Cuddlehead met in the square by the waterfront.
Cuddlehead greeted the major affably.  As
the major was very thirsty he returned the salutation.
A glance through the door at his elbow displayed,
to Mr. Cuddlehead's uncertain eyes, a number
of round tables with chairs about them.  He took
out his watch and examined it.
</p>

<p>
"Eleven-thirty&mdash;I always take something at
half-past eleven.  I hope you will join me," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I seldom drink before lunch," replied Farrington,
"but as this is an exceptionally dry day&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
They passed through the doorway and sat down
at the nearest table.
</p>

<p>
"Now I will find out what is doing," thought
Cuddlehead, and gave his order.  But for a long time
the major's tongue refused to be loosened.  He
sipped his liquor, and watched his companion with
eyes of unfriendly suspicion.  Cuddlehead, in the
meantime, exhibited an excellent temper, put a few
casual questions, and chatted about small things of
general interest.
</p>

<p>
Now Cuddlehead had heard, from the captain of
the mail-boat, something about a wealthy American
with a bee in his bonnet and a pretty daughter,
somewhere within reach of Pernambuco.  The story had
grown upon him, and a great idea had taken shape
in his scheming mind.  Why shouldn't he, if all that
people said and wrote about American girls was
true?  By gad, he'd make a shot at it.  He'd show
them how to spend their money in more interesting
places than the back of nowhere.  As soon as the
major began to look more friendly, under the
influence of the crude whiskey, he produced his
cigar-case,&mdash;a fat black leather affair, with an engraved
silver plate on the front of it,&mdash;and offered the
old man an excellent weed of Havana.  The major
took it, glancing keenly, but swiftly, at the initials
on the case as he did so.  "P. doesn't stand for
Cuddlehead," he thought, but said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me something about the man who owns
a whole country, somewhere back here, in the bush,"
urged Cuddlehead, lightly.  The old man's muddled
wits awoke and jerked a warning.  Here was some
scum of Heaven knows where, wanting to interfere
in a better man's business.
</p>

<p>
"What's that, my boy?" he asked, looking
stupidly interested.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is of no importance.  It just struck me
as being a bit out of the way," replied the other.
</p>

<p>
"What?" inquired the major.
</p>

<p>
"The place Mr. Tetson hangs out," laughed Cuddlehead.
</p>

<p>
"It's all that, my boy," replied Farrington,
gleefully; then he stared, open-mouthed.  "At least,"
he added, "it may be, but what the hell are you
gabbing about?"
</p>

<p>
"Sorry.  Had no idea it was a secret," retorted
the younger man.
</p>

<p>
The major's potations flooded to his head.  His
face took on a darker shade of crimson.  His hands
twitched on the table.
</p>

<p>
"Secrets!  You d&mdash;n little sneak," he roared,
staggering up and overturning his chair.  The expression
of insolence faded from Cuddlehead's face.  He
dashed out of the place without paying for the bottle
of whiskey.  On the pavement he paused, long
enough to compose his features and straighten his
necktie.  Then he went to the ship-chandler and
gathered a wealth of information concerning Harris
William Tetson.  But he heard no mention of
Hemming being in the country, which was, perhaps,
just as well.  He was certainly a sneak, as more
than the major had called him, but he was not
altogether a duffer.  He could look after himself to a
certain extent.  He decided to keep Pernambuco
until later, and go now for bigger game.  He made
his plans speedily, fearing another meeting with the
major, and early next morning started along the
coast, inside the reef, as a passenger aboard a native
<i>barcassa</i>.  The voyage to the mouth of the river
Plado would take the better part of a day.  He
would wait in the little village for Mr. Tetson's
steam-launch, which made weekly runs to the coast
for mail and supplies.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
HEMMING LEARNS SOMETHING ABOUT HIS ARMY
</h3>

<p>
In Pernamba, up the Plado, life had taken on
a brighter aspect for at least two of the inhabitants.
Marion Tetson was thankful beyond the power of
speech, because the fever had left Hicks.  True, it
had left him thin and weak as a baby, but his very
helplessness made him dearer in her eyes.  That
one who had been so big and strong should ask
her to lift his head whenever he wanted a drink,
and should have his pillow turned for him without
displaying a sign of rebellion, stabbed her to the
innermost soul with wonder and pity.  Hicks was
happy because she was near him all day, her eyes
telling what her lips were longing to say, if his
dared to question.  Then he could half remember
some things which were as part of his
dreaming&mdash;wonderful, magic things with all the glamour of
dreams, free from the weariness of the fever.  But
he said nothing of these just then to Marion, though
she read his thoughts like a book while he lay there
very quiet, smiling a little, his gaze following her
every movement.  To Hemming also he wore his
heart on his sleeve.  Of this fact he was blissfully
ignorant.  Mrs. Tetson often came to his room and
gave him motherly advice about not talking too much
and not thinking too hard.  Hicks felt no desire
to talk, but as for thinking, Lord, she might as well
have told him to stop breathing.  He thought more
in ten minutes now than he had before in any three
hours.  They were comforting thoughts, though, for
the most part, and Marion knew that they did him
more good than harm.
</p>

<p>
Hemming kept up a show of interest in the army.
He lectured the officers and drilled the men, and
dined almost every night at the mess, which he had
remodelled on the English plan.  But most of the
time he kept his eye on the President.  It was a
job he did not care about,&mdash;this prying into
another man's business,&mdash;but somehow he could not
put it by him, things were so obviously out of order.
He kept his monocle polished, his ears open, and
his mouth shut.  He was always willing to listen
to the President's dreary conversations.  The life
lacked excitement for one who had run the gauntlet
of a hundred vital dangers.  He had given up all
special correspondence, but did a good deal of
fiction when the mood was on him.  The longing to
return to a more active existence grew stronger
every day, but his friendship for the Tetsons and for
Hicks kept him at his post.
</p>

<p>
Hemming's morning coffee was always served in
his room at six o'clock.  That left him about two
and a half hours of the cool of the day in which to
work.  Breakfast, with its queer dishes of hot meats,
and claret, tea, and coffee to drink, came on about
nine.  Breakfast was a family affair, and after it
every one retired for a nap.  Hemming usually drank
his coffee before he dressed, but one morning Smith
found him pacing the room, booted and spurred, and
attired in stained breeches and a faded tunic.  There
were cigar ashes on the floor beside the bed.  A
volume of Stevenson's "Men and Books" lay open on
the pillow.
</p>

<p>
"Fill my flask," he said, "and let the President
know that I may not be back until evening."
</p>

<p>
"Very good, sir," replied the valet.  "Will I
order your horse, sir?"
</p>

<p>
While the man was out of the room Hemming
pulled open a drawer in his desk, in search of
revolver cartridges.  The contents of the drawer were
in a shocking jumble.  In his despatch-box at large
among his papers he found half a dozen cartridges,
a cigarette from the army and navy stores at home,
and a small bow of black ribbon.  He picked up the
bow, kissed it lightly, and instead of restoring it to
the box put it in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"She liked me well enough in those days&mdash;or
else she did some&mdash;ah&mdash;remarkable acting," he
said.
</p>

<p>
Turning on his heel he found Smith in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
Your horse is ready, sir," said the man.  Hemming
blushed, and, to hide his confusion, told Smith
to go to the devil.  He rode away with an unloaded
revolver in his holster.
</p>

<p>
"It must be a pretty rotten country," soliloquized
the valet, "when a single-eye-glassed, right-about-turn,
warranted-not-to-shrink-wear-or-tear gent like
that gets buggy before breakfast."
</p>

<p>
The commander-in-chief rode from the gardens
by the same gate at which he had entered for the
first time only a month before.  He did not return
the salute of a corporal in the door of the
guard-house.  He did not notice the little brown soldier
at the gate, who stood at attention upon his
approach, and presented arms as he passed&mdash;which
was, perhaps, just as well, for a freshly lighted
cigarette smoked on the ground at the man's feet.
He turned his horse's head northward.  On both
sides of the street arose the straight brown boles of
the royal palms, and high above the morning wind
sang in the stiff foliage.  At the end of the street
he turned into the path by which he had first
entered the town.  The country folk urged their horses
into the bush that he might pass, and he rode by
unheeding.  In their simple minds they wondered
at this, for the fame of his alert perception and
flashing eye-glass had gone far and near.  Of his
own accord the white stallion came to a standstill
before a hut.  Hemming looked up, his reverie
broken, and his thoughts returned to Pernamba.
</p>

<p>
A woman came to the narrow doorway and
greeted him with reverence.  He recognized in her
the woman who had first welcomed him to the
country.  He dismounted and held out his hand.
</p>

<p>
"How is the little fellow?" he asked.  At that
the tears sprang into her eyes, and Hemming saw
that her face was drawn with sorrow.  He followed
her into the dim interior of the hut.  The boy lay
in a corner, upon an untidy bed, and above him stood
the English doctor.  The two men shook hands.
</p>

<p>
"I can clear him of the fever," said the doctor,
"but what for?  It's easier to die of fever than
of starvation."
</p>

<p>
"Starvation," exclaimed Hemming, "why starvation?"
</p>

<p>
"The seÃ±or does not know," said the woman.  "It
is not in his kind heart to ruin the poor, and bring
sorrow to the humble."
</p>

<p>
"But," said the doctor, looking at Hemming, "to
Englishmen of our class, a nigger is a nigger, say
what you please, and the ends-of-the-earth is a place
to make money and London is the place to spend it."
</p>

<p>
The soldier's face whitened beneath the tan.
</p>

<p>
"Don't judge me by your own standards, Scott,
simply because you were born a gentleman," he
said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," laughed the doctor, "to me money would
be of no use, even in London.  I find the
ends-of-the-earth a place to hide my head."
</p>

<p>
"But what of starvation and ruin?" asked the
other.
</p>

<p>
"I thought," replied the doctor, "that you were
in command of the army.  Ask those mud-faced
soldiers of yours why this woman has nothing to
feed to her child."
</p>

<p>
"I <i>will</i> ask them," said the commander-in-chief,
and he ripped out an oath that did Scott's heart
good to hear.  He turned to the woman.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry for this," he said, "and will see that
all that was taken from you is safely returned.  The
President and I knew nothing about it."  He drew
a wad of notes from his pocket and handed it to her.
Then he looked at the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"If I did not like you, Scott, and respect you,"
he continued, "I'd punch your head for thinking this
of me.  But you had both the grace and courage to
tell me what you thought."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think it now," said Scott, "and I don't
want my head punched, either, for my flesh heals
very slowly.  But if I ever feel in need of a
thrashing, old man, I'll call on you.  No doubt it would
be painful, but there'd be no element of disgrace
connected with it."
</p>

<p>
Hemming blushed, for compliments always put
him out of the game.  The woman suddenly stepped
closer, and, snatching his hand to her face, kissed it
twice before he could pull it away.  He retreated to
the door, and the doctor laughed.  Safe in the saddle,
he called to the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap," he said, "you have inspired me
to a confession.  I, too, have soured on London."
</p>

<p>
"Let me advise you to try your luck again.  A
girl is sometimes put in a false light by
circumstances&mdash;-the greed of parents, for instance," replied
Scott.
</p>

<p>
Hemming stared, unable to conceal his amazement.
</p>

<p>
"I have not always lived in Pernamba," laughed
Scott, "I have dined more than once at your mess.
Fact is, I was at one time surgeon in the Sixty-Second."
</p>

<p>
"You are a dry one, certainly," said Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"It is unkind of you to remind me of it when
the nearest bottle of soda is at least three miles away,
and very likely warm at that," retorted the doctor.
Hemming leaned forward in his saddle and grasped
his hand.
</p>

<p>
"I will not take your advice," he said, "but it
was kind of you to give it.  Forgive me for
mentioning it, Scott, but you are a dashed good sort."
</p>

<p>
"Man," cried the other, "didn't I tell you that
I am hiding my head?"  He slapped the white
stallion smartly on the rump, and Hemming went
up the trail at a canter.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
CAPTAIN SANTOSA VISITS HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER
</h3>

<p>
Hemming got back to the village in time to change
and dine with the family.  The President's mind was
otherwhere than at the table.  He would look about
the room, staring at the shadows beyond the candle-light,
as if seeking something.  He pushed the claret
past him, and ordered rye whiskey.  His kind face
showed lines unknown to it a month before.
Mrs. Tetson watched him anxiously.  Marion and the
commander-in-chief talked together like well-tried
comrades, laughing sometimes, but for the most part
serious.  Marion was paler than of old, but none
the less beautiful for that.  Her eyes were brighter,
with a light that seemed to burn far back in them,
steady and tender.  Her lips were ever on the verge
of smiling.  Hemming told her all of his interview
with the peasant woman, and part of his interview
with Scott.
</p>

<p>
"There will be trouble soon," he said.
</p>

<p>
She begged him not to stir it up until Valentine
was well enough to have a finger in it.
</p>

<p>
"You may not think him very clever," she said,
"but even you will admit that he shoots straight,
and has courage."
</p>

<p>
"I will admit anything in his favour," replied
Hemming, "but as for his shooting, why, thank
Heaven, I have never tested it."
</p>

<p>
"Wasn't he very rude to you one night?" she
asked.
</p>

<p>
He laughed quietly.  "The circumstances warranted
it, but he was rude to the wrong person, don't
you think?"
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed," she cried, "for no matter how
minus a quantity your guilt, or how full of fault
I had been, it would never have done for him to
threaten me with a&mdash;"  She paused.
</p>

<p>
"Service revolver?" said Hemming, "and one of
my own at that."
</p>

<p>
"Fever is a terrible thing," she said, gazing at the
red heart of the claret.
</p>

<p>
"My dear sister," said the Englishman, "a man
would gladly suffer more to win less."
</p>

<p>
They smiled frankly into one another's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Then you do not think too badly of me?" she
asked.
</p>

<p>
"I think everything that is jolly&mdash;of both of
you," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"I like your friendship," she said, "for, though
you seem such a good companion, I do not believe
you give it lightly."
</p>

<p>
After the coffee and an aimless talk with Tetson,
Hemming looked in at Hicks and found him drinking
chicken broth as if he liked it.  The invalid was
strong enough to manage the spoon himself, but
Marion held the bowl.  Hemming went to his own
room, turned on the light above his desk, and began
to write.  He worked steadily until ten o'clock.
Then he walked up and down the room for awhile,
rolling and smoking cigarettes.  The old ambition
had him in its clutches.  Pernamba, with its heat,
its dulness, its love and hate, had faded away.  Now
he played a bigger game&mdash;a game for the world
rather than for half a battalion of little brown
soldiers.  A knock sounded on his door, and, before
he could answer it, Captain Santosa, glorious in his
white and gold, stepped into the room.  The sight
of the Brazilian brought his dreams to the dust.
"Damn," he said, under his breath.
</p>

<p>
Then he waved his subordinate to a seat.
</p>

<p>
The captain's manner was as courteous as ever,
his smile as urbane, his eyes as unfathomable.  But
his dusky cheek showed an unusual pallor, and as he
sat down he groaned.  Hemming eyed him sharply;
men like Santosa do not groan unless they are
wounded&mdash;maybe in their pride, by a friend's word,
maybe in their vitals by an enemy's knife.  There
was no sign of blood on the spotless uniform.
</p>

<p>
"A drink?" queried Hemming, turning toward
the bell.
</p>

<p>
"Not now," said the captain, "but afterward, if
you then offer it to me."  He swallowed hard, looked
down at his polished boots, aloft at the ceiling, and
presently at his superior officer's staring eye-glass.
From this he seemed to gather courage.
</p>

<p>
"I have disturbed you at your rest, at your
private work," he said, with a motion of the hand
toward the untidy desk, "but my need is great.  I
must choose between disloyalty to my brother officers,
and disloyalty to you and the President.  I have
chosen, sir, and I now resign my commission.  I will
no longer ride and drink and eat with robbers and
liars.  It is not work for a gentleman."  He paused
and smiled pathetically.  "I will go away.  There
is nothing else for my father's son to do."
</p>

<p>
"I heard something of this&mdash;no longer ago than
to-day," said Hemming.
</p>

<p>
Santosa lit a cigar and puffed for awhile in silence.
</p>

<p>
"I winked at it too long," he said, at last, "for
I was dreaming of other things.  So that I kept my
own hands clean I did not care.  Then you came, and
I watched you.  I saw that duty was the great thing,
after all&mdash;even for a soldier.  And I saw that even
a gentleman might earn his pay decently."
</p>

<p>
Hemming smiled, and polished his eye-glass on
the lining of his dinner-jacket.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, old chap.  You have a queer way of
putting it, but I catch the idea," he said.
</p>

<p>
The captain bowed.  "I will go away, but not
very far, for I would like to be near, to help you
in any trouble.  Our dear friend Valentine, whom
I love as a brother, is not yet strong.  The President,
whom I honour, is not a fighter, I think.  The
ladies should go to the coast."
</p>

<p>
"You are right," said Hemming, "but do not
leave us for a day or two.  I will consider your
resignation.  Now for a drink."
</p>

<p>
He rang the bell, and then pulled a chair close to
Santosa.  When Smith had gone from the room,
leaving the decanter and soda-water behind him, the
two soldiers touched glasses and drank.  They were
silent.  The Brazilian felt better now, and the
Englishman was thinking too hard to talk.  A gust of
wind banged the wooden shutters at the windows.
It was followed by a flash of lightning.  Then came
the rain, pounding and splashing on the roof, and
hammering the palms in the garden.
</p>

<p>
"That's sudden," said Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Things happen suddenly in this country,"
replied Santosa.
</p>

<p>
Hemming leaned back and crossed his legs.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen Hicks since the fever bowled
him?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No," replied the captain, "no, I have not seen
him, but he is my friend and I wish him well.  Is
it not through our friends, Hemming, that we come
by our griefs?  It has seemed so to me."
</p>

<p>
Hemming glanced at him quickly, but said nothing.
Santosa was a gentleman, and might safely be
allowed to make confessions.
</p>

<p>
"When I first came here," continued the captain,
"I was poor, and the Brazilian army owed me a
whole year's back pay.  I had spent much on clothes
and on horses, trying hard to live like my father's
son.  Mr. Tetson offered me better pay, and a gayer
uniform.  I was willing to play at soldiering, for
I saw that some gain might be made from it, outside
the pay.  My brother officers saw this also, and
we talked of it often.  Then Miss Tetson came to
Pernamba.  I rode out with her to show her the
country.  I told her of my father, and of how, when
they carried him in from the field, they found that
the Order of Bolivar had been driven edgewise
through his tunic and into his breast by the blow
of a bullet.  And when I saw the look on her face,
my pride grew, but changed in some way, and it
seemed to me that the son of that man should leave
thieving and the crushing of the poor to men of less
distinction.
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes my heart was bitter within me, and
my fingers itched for the feel of Valentine's throat.
But I hope I was always polite, Hemming."  He
got lightly to his feet, and held out his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Young ladies talk so in convent-schools," he
said.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," replied Hemming, gravely, "and
I can assure you that your attitude toward all
concerned has left nothing to be desired.  I will look
you up at your quarters after breakfast."
</p>

<p>
Captain Santosa went through the gardens,
humming a Spanish love-song.  He turned near a
fountain and looked up at a lighted window.  His white
uniform gleamed in the scented dusk.  He kissed
his finger-tips to the window.  "The end of that
dream," he said, lightly, and his eyes were as
unfathomable as ever.  The water dripped heavily on
to the gold of his uniform.
</p>

<p>
Hemming went in search of the President, and
found him in the billiard-room, idly knocking the
balls about with a rasping cue.
</p>

<p>
"Have a game, like a good chap," urged the
great man.
</p>

<p>
The commander-in-chief shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Not now, sir.  I came to tell you something
about the army," he replied.  He was shocked at
Tetson's sudden pallor.  The yellow cigar was
dropped from nerveless fingers and smeared a white
trail of ash across the green cloth.
</p>

<p>
"What do they want?" asked Tetson, in a husky
voice.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they take whatever they want," replied
Hemming; "the taxes that are due you, and
something besides from the unprotected."  Then he
retailed the case of the poor woman.  When he had
finished Tetson did not speak immediately.  His
benevolent face wore an expression that cut
Hemming to the heart.
</p>

<p>
"I must think it over," he said, wearily, "I must
think it over."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
MR. CUDDLEHEAD ARRIVES
</h3>

<p>
Mr. Cuddlehead's trip, though free from serious
accident, had been extremely trying.  The <i>barcassa</i>
had cramped his legs, and the smell of the native
cooking, in so confined a space, had unsettled his
stomach.  He had been compelled to wait three days
in the uninteresting village at the mouth of the
Plado, unable to hurry the leisurely crew of the
launch.  But at last the undesirable journey came
to an end, and with a sigh of relief he issued from
beneath the smoke-begrimed awning, and stretched
his legs on the little wharf at Pernamba.  He looked
at the deserted warehouses along the river-front, and
a foreboding of disaster chilled him.  The afternoon
lay close and bright in the unhealthy valley, and the
very peacefulness of the scene awoke a phantom of
fear in his heart.  What if the President were a
man of the world after all, with a knowledge of
men and the signs on their faces?  Why, then,
good-bye to all hope of the family circle.
</p>

<p>
A black boy accosted Cuddlehead, awaking him
from his depressing surmises.  The nigger gabbled
in the language of the country.  Then he pointed
at the traveller's bag.
</p>

<p>
"Take it, by all means," said Cuddlehead.
</p>

<p>
There is one hostelry in Pernamba, on a side street
behind the military stables.  It is small and not
very clean.  To this place the boy led Cuddlehead,
and at the door demanded five hundred reis&mdash;the
equivalent of sixpence.  Cuddlehead doubled the
sum, for after all he had done very well of late, and
a favourable impression is a good thing to make in
a new stamping-ground, even on a nigger.  The
proprietor of the inn bowed him to the only habitable
guest-chamber.  Here he bathed, as well as he could
with two small jugs of water and his shaving-soap,
and then changed into a suit of clean white linen.
With a cigarette between his lips and a light rattan
in his hand, Cuddlehead was himself again.  He
swaggered into the narrow street and started in
search of the President's villa.  He passed a group
of soldiers puffing their cigarettes in a doorway, who
stared after him with interest and some misgivings.
"Was the place to be invaded by Englishmen?"
they wondered.  He saw a brown girl of attractive
appearance, rolling cigars beside an open window.
He entered the humble habitation, and, after
examining the samples of leaf, in sign language
ordered a hundred cigars.  Then he embraced the girl,
and was promptly slapped across the face and pushed
out of the shop.
</p>

<p>
"What airs these d&mdash;n niggers put on," he
muttered, "but maybe I was a bit indiscreet."
</p>

<p>
Here, already, was the hand of Hemming against
him, though he did not know it; for Hemming, also,
had bought cigars from the girl, and had treated her
as he treated all women, thereby establishing her
self-respect above the attentions of men with eyes
like Cuddlehead's.
</p>

<p>
Cuddlehead found the gates open to the
President's grounds without much trouble, and was
halted by the sentry.  He produced his card-case.
The sentry whistled.  The corporal issued from the
guard-house, with his tunic open and his belt
dangling.
</p>

<p>
Just then Captain Santosa entered from the street,
with, in the metaphorical phrase of a certain
whist-playing poet, "a smile on his face, and a club in
his hand."  He swore at the corporal, who retreated
to the guard-house, fumbling at his buttons.  He
bowed to Cuddlehead, and glanced at the card.
</p>

<p>
"You would like to see the President?" he said.
"Then I will escort you to the door."  He caught
up his sword and hooked it short to his belt, wheeled
like a drill-sergeant, and fitted his stride to
Cuddlehead's.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tetson received the visitor in his airy office.
He seemed disturbed in mind, wondering, perhaps,
if this were a dun from some wholesale establishment
on the coast.  He had been working on his books all
the morning, and had caught a glimpse of ruin, like a
great shadow, across the tidy pages.  But he
managed to welcome Cuddlehead heartily enough.
</p>

<p>
"You must stay to dinner, sir,&mdash;pot-luck,&mdash;very
informal, you know," he said, hospitably.  He leaned
against the desk and passed his hand across his
forehead.  He could not keep his mind from working
back to the sheets of ruled paper.
</p>

<p>
"Ten thousand," he pondered, "ten thousand for
April alone, and nothing to put against it.  The
army wanting its pay, and robbing me of all I have.
Gregory's coal bill as long as my leg.  Sugar gone
to the devil!"  He sighed, mopped his face, and
looked at Cuddlehead, who all the while had been
observing him with furtive, inquiring eyes.  He
offered a yellow cigar, and lit one himself.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me a moment," he said.  "I have something
to see to.  Here are some English papers.
I'll be back immediately, Mr. Cuddlehead, and then
maybe we can have a game of billiards."
</p>

<p>
He went hurriedly from the room.
</p>

<p>
"You are a foolish old party," remarked Cuddlehead
to the closed door, "and, no doubt, you'll be
all the easier for that.  Hope your daughter is a
better looker, that's all."
</p>

<p>
He tossed the offensive cigar into the garden, and
seated himself in the chair by the desk.  His courage
was growing.
</p>

<p>
At the hall door Mr. Tetson met Hemming
entering.  The commander was booted and spurred.
</p>

<p>
"Are you busy?" inquired the President.
"There's a visitor in here."
</p>

<p>
The Englishman glared.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, I am busy," he replied.  "I've caught
my command in seven of their thieving tricks, and
have ridden thirty miles to do it.  I've told the
whole regiment what I think of them, and now I
must dine at the mess, to see that they don't concoct
any schemes to murder me."
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you time for a game of billiards with
Mr. Cuddlehead?" asked Mr. Tetson.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, I have not," replied Hemming, crisply,
and tramped away to change his clothes.  "The old
ass," he muttered, under his breath.
</p>

<p>
Dinner that night was a dull affair.  Hemming
and Hicks were both absent from the table.
Cuddlehead had excellent manners, and all the outward
signs of social grace, but a warning was marked on
his face.  The President tried to be entertaining,
but the terror of an impending disturbance, and even
of ruin, hung over him.  Mrs. Tetson, guessing
somewhat of her husband's troubles, sat pale and
fearful.  Marion was polite, with a politeness that,
after two or three essays of gallantry on Cuddlehead's
part, left him inwardly squirming.  After
dinner Miss Tetson described the visitor to Hicks,
mentioning the horrible mouth, the shifting eyes, and
the odious attentions.
</p>

<p>
"He must be pretty bad, for you to talk about
him," said Valentine, in wonder.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if I had never seen men like you and
Mr. Hemming," she answered, "he would not seem so
utterly ridiculous."
</p>

<p>
Hicks was in a chair by the window, and Marion
was perched on the arm of it.  His eyes were
desperate.  Hers were bright and daring.  Her mouth
was tremulous.
</p>

<p>
"I can understand your admiration for Hemming,"
he said.  "He is the best chap on earth,
barring only you."
</p>

<p>
Marion smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder," he continued, presently, "I wonder
if&mdash;that was all a dream?"
</p>

<p>
"What?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could see you," he said.  "I believe
you are laughing at me up there."
</p>

<p>
"I am laughing," she replied, "but I don't know
why exactly."
</p>

<p>
"At my stupidity, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"You are certainly very stupid."
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm a coward."
</p>

<p>
"What are you afraid of?"
</p>

<p>
He leaned back as far as he could, trying to see
her face.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid you pity me&mdash;and don't love me,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
He breathed hard after that, as if he had run a
mile.
</p>

<p>
"I am not modest enough to pity you," she said,
softly, "though no doubt you are deserving of pity."
</p>

<p>
"Marion," he whispered, "for God's sake, don't.
I'm too blind with anxiety to read riddles.  Tell me
straight&mdash;do you love me?  Have I even the ghost
of a chance?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you believe in ghosts?" asked she, with
trembling laughter, and, bending forward, with a
hand on either of his thin shoulders, she pressed her
cheek to his.
</p>

<p>
While love had his innings in the sick-room, below
curiosity led the feet of Mr. Cuddlehead toward the
officers' quarters on the outskirts of the town.  The
night was fine, and not oppressively close.  A breeze
from the hills made liquid stir in the higher foliage.
Cuddlehead felt in his blood a hint of something
unusual, as he took his way through the President's
wide gardens, and out to the road.  No sentinel
paced, sabre at shoulder, before the little guard-house.
The troopers stood in groups along the street,
smoking and talking.  The smoke of their pungent
cigarettes drifted on the air, and the murmur of
their voices rang with a low note of menace.
Unmolested, Cuddlehead reached the long white building
where the officers of this inconsiderable army
lodged and messed.  Through the open windows
glowed a subdued light from the shaded lamps above
the table.  The compassing verandas were but
partially illuminated by the glow from within, and
silent men stood here and there in the shadows,
motionless and expectant.  At Cuddlehead's approach,
the nearer ones hesitated for a moment, and
then drew away.
</p>

<p>
"There is something rotten," quoted Cuddlehead,
under his breath, and looked cautiously in.  For a
moment the array of faultless, gaudy mess-jackets
startled him.  In the sight of an apparently
civilized military mess there was, to him, a
suggestion of danger.  Recovering his composure, he
looked again.  The faces up and down the table were
dark, and, for the most part, sullen.  At the head of
the board, with his face toward the onlooker's place
of vantage, sat Hemming.  His shoulders were
squared.  His eye-glass gleamed in the lamplight.
Cuddlehead stared at the commander-in-chief with
a fearful, spellbound gaze.  His hands clutched at
the low window-sill.  His breath seemed to hang in
his windpipe.  At last he straightened himself,
moistened his craven lips with his tongue, and went
stealthily away.  Safe in his own room in the quiet
inn, he took a shrewd nip of raw brandy.
</p>

<p>
"What the devil," he asked himself, "brought
that righteous, immaculate fool to this God-forsaken
place?"
</p>

<p>
Two things were uppermost in his memory&mdash;a
caning once given to a cad, and a shilling once tossed
to a beggar.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
THE FIRST SHOT
</h3>

<p>
Mr. Cuddlehead did not go far afield during
the day following his glimpse of the officers'
dinner-table.  Instead, he kept to his room until evening,
or at most took a furtive turn or two on the cobbles
before the inn door.  After his lonely and not very
palatable dinner was over, he set out cautiously for
the President's villa.  He wanted to have a talk with
Miss Tetson alone.  She, no doubt, could explain
matters to him, so that he might be able to decide
on a course of action.  He walked slowly, keeping
always a vigilant look-out for the trim, dauntless
figure of Herbert Hemming.  At the great gateway
the brown boy on sentry-go saluted, and let him
pass without question.  In return he treated the
fellow to his blandest smile and a <i>milreis</i> note.  He
did not keep long to the drive, but turned off into
a narrow path as soon as he felt that the soldier had
ceased watching him.  He took his time, traversing
winding paths between low tropical shrubs and
yellow-stemmed bamboo, but always drawing nearer
to the quiet mansion.  Presently his ear caught a
welcome sound,&mdash;the soft, frivolous strumming
of a banjo.  He was aware that Hemming was not
musical; in fact, he remembered that his rendering
of "Father O'Flynn" had once been mistaken for
the national anthem.
</p>

<p>
Cuddlehead found Miss Tetson on a stone seat,
near her favourite fountain.  At sight of him, she
stopped her idle playing, and answered his salutation
with the coldest of bows.  Her lover's kisses
still burned on her lips, and words of his impulsive
wooing still rang sweetly in her ears.  Even the
little brown crane, that stood there watching the
sparkling water with eyes like yellow jewels,
reminded her of a certain evening when she had been
unkind to Valentine Hicks.  The hour was not for
Cuddlehead.
</p>

<p>
Undisturbed by the coolness of his reception,
Mr. Cuddlehead seated himself at the far end of the
bench, and began to talk.  He described his journey
from Pernambuco to Pernamba, and with so fine
a wit that Marion smiled.  He told little anecdotes
of his past, very clever, and very vague as to dates
and scenes.  The girl almost forgot the sinister
aspect of his face in the charm of his conversation,
and when he mentioned Hemming, in terms of
warmest respect, she confided to him something
of his trouble with the army.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I can be of some use; one Englishman
should be good for ten of those niggers," he said.
He lifted the banjo from the seat, and made it dance
and sing through the newest Southern melody.  His
touch was both dainty and brilliant.  He replaced the
instrument on the seat between them.  He saw that
the girl was more favourably impressed with him
than she had been.  For a little while they kept
silence, and her thoughts returned to Valentine
Hicks.  Suddenly they heard Hemming's voice,
pitched low and sharp, in anger.  He was hidden
from them by shrubs of tangled growth.
</p>

<p>
"I have given my orders," he said.  "Do you
understand?"
</p>

<p>
The thick voice of the colonel made reply in
spluttering oaths.
</p>

<p>
"No more of that," said Hemming, fiercely.
</p>

<p>
Marion heard the crunch of his heels on the path
as he wheeled.  Cuddlehead held his breath, the
better to hear, and a quotation about a house divided
against itself came imperfectly to his mind.
</p>

<p>
The heavy footsteps of the native officer were
heard retreating.  Presently Hemming rounded the
hedge of roses, and stood by the fountain.  By the
faint starlight the watchers saw that he was smiling.
He lit a cigarette with deliberate care, and dropped
the match into the shallow basin of the fountain.
He lit another match and looked at his watch.  He
had the air of one keeping a tryst.  Santosa came
out of the shadows beyond, booted and spurred.
The two men shook hands, and whispered together.
Their backs were turned square upon the occupants
of the bench.  Then Hemming produced a long
packet of papers and gave them to Santosa.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Tetson has signed them all," he said, "and
the major will see to the business part of it.
Impress the importance of the matter upon him, and
then hurry back, for I'm afraid these idiots intend
making this unpleasant for us.  And now, old
man, good luck and God bless you.  It is a fine
night for a ride."
</p>

<p>
"A beautiful night," replied Santosa, "and on
such a night I must either make love to my friends
or trouble for my enemies."
</p>

<p>
He turned on his heel and clanked away.
</p>

<p>
All this time Marion had sat as one spellbound.
Now she looked toward the other end of the stone
seat.  Cuddlehead had gone.  She called to
Hemming.  He started at the sound of her voice.  "You
here?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and so was Mr. Cuddlehead a moment
ago.  But he sneaked off, the little cad."
</p>

<p>
"Did he see the papers?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'm sure he did," she replied.
</p>

<p>
"You had better run into the house," he said.
"I'll look for the spy."
</p>

<p>
Marion hastened indoors, and told Hicks all she
knew about the trouble.  The young man looked
deeply concerned.
</p>

<p>
"I wish Hemming had come to us a year ago,"
he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Could he have helped it?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I believe he would have opened our eyes, dear,
before things got into such an awful mess,"
replied her lover.
</p>

<p>
"But surely we are not in any danger," she
urged.  "Surely Mr. Hemming and father can quiet
them."
</p>

<p>
"Our lives are safe enough, but the little fools
may break some windows.  You see, dear, the
President and I have not watched them as we should.
We have let them rob us right and left, and now,
when Hemming tries to spoil their game, and force
them to divvy up, they evidently want to bully us.
It's in their blood, you know,&mdash;this revolution
business."  Having thus unbosomed himself, Hicks
leaned weakly back in his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest," he said, presently, "will you bring
me my Winchester&mdash;it's in the boot closet&mdash;and
that bag of cartridges on my writing-table."
</p>

<p>
The girl brought them, and Hicks oiled the breech
of the rifle.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later the President and Mrs. Tetson
entered the secretary's sitting-room.  They
found that gentleman sorting out heaps of
cartridges, while their daughter sat near him busily
scrubbing sections of a Colt's revolver with a
toothbrush.  The President's face displayed shame and
consternation.
</p>

<p>
"God help us! we are ruined," he said, looking
from one to another with bloodshot eyes.
</p>

<p>
He produced a yellow cigar from a shabby case,
and seated himself close to the window.  Suddenly
he stood up and looked out.
</p>

<p>
"Who's that?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Hemming," came the faint reply.
</p>

<p>
A rifle cracked, and the bullet splintered the slats
of the shutter.  The President retired into the room
and turned off the lights.
</p>

<p>
"Hemming was right.  They mean to force me,"
he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
Hicks tottered to the window, rifle in hand.  The
sounds of a violent scuffle arose from the flowerbeds.
Hicks could just make out a rolling, twisting
mass below.
</p>

<p>
"Hold your fire," gasped a voice which he
recognized as Hemming's.  Presently the mass ceased
its uneasy movements, and divided itself into two
equal parts, one of which continued to lie among the
crushed flowers, while the other staggered along the
wall of the house and entered the dining-room by
a window.  The President, carrying a revolver
awkwardly, hurried down-stairs.  Presently he returned,
he and Smith leading Hemming between them.
Hemming was limp, and his pale face was streaked
with dust and sweat.  Blood dripped from his left
sleeve.  His monocle was gone.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Tetson, if you'll tie up my arm,&mdash;I'll
show you how,&mdash;I'll be fit as a fiddle," he said,
and sank into a chair.
</p>

<p>
"Gun?" queried Hicks, who knelt by the window,
with his rifle on the sill.
</p>

<p>
"Knife," replied Hemming.
</p>

<p>
Marion cut away the sleeve of his jacket.  "Surely
Mr. Cuddlehead did not carry a knife," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think so; I jumped on the wrong man.
Heard some one crawling through the bushes, and
thought I had him.  One of my own troopers&mdash;he
stuck me in the muscles,&mdash;bleeds a bit, that's all,"
he replied.
</p>

<p>
"There's not a sound in the garden now," said
Hicks.
</p>

<p>
"Who fired the shot?" asked Tetson.
</p>

<p>
"A corporal," said Hemming.  "He was behind
me when you spoke.  I didn't know&mdash;any one&mdash;was
near.  He'll never&mdash;fire another&mdash;shot."  Then
the commander-in-chief fainted on Valentine's
bed, and Smith brought him around with cold water
and brandy.  Then Smith stole away from the villa
toward the barracks.  It was close upon dawn when
he returned.
</p>

<p>
"They think they'll kidnap the President and the
ladies, and take them away up-country and hold
them for a ransom; it is the stranger's idea," he
informed them.
</p>

<p>
The President turned a shade paler, and glanced
apprehensively at his wife and daughter.  Hicks
swore.  Hemming sat up and slid his feet to the
floor.
</p>

<p>
"They are fools,&mdash;and Cuddlehead must be
mad," he exclaimed.  Tetson went over to his wife.
</p>

<p>
"Can you forgive me, dear?" he asked, huskily.
For answer she kissed him.
</p>

<p>
The villa was left undisturbed all the following
day.  Again darkness came.  The gardens were
deserted.  Smith had crawled around the house
four times without hearing a sound or attracting
a shot.  The troopers were crowded together on
and about the verandas of the officers' quarters,
listening to the heated discussions of their superiors,
Cuddlehead was with the officers, he and the colonel
pouring their whiskey from the same decanter.  A
dark and silent procession moved from the
President's villa down to the river, where the little
steamer lay with her boilers hot.  Mr. Tetson
carried a small bag filled with sovereigns and a basket
of food.  Marion and Mrs. Tetson and two maids
followed with wraps, baskets, and firearms.  Smith
scouted ahead.  Hemming and Hicks walked feebly
behind, armed and alert.  The things were passed
smartly aboard.  The mooring-line was cleared.
Hicks steadied himself by Marion's arm.
</p>

<p>
"We will soon follow you," he said.  "Then
you will think better of me than if I went now."
</p>

<p>
They were very close together, and the others
were all busy crawling under the dirty awnings, or
saying good-bye.
</p>

<p>
"I am poor as Job's turkey," he said.
</p>

<p>
"And my father is ruined," she replied.
</p>

<p>
"When will you marry me?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"As soon as you come for me,&mdash;in Pernambuco,
or New York, or&mdash;anywhere," she answered.
Then she kissed him, and at the touch of her tear-wet
face his heart leaped as if it would leave its
place in his side to follow her.
</p>

<p>
The little steamer swung into the current, and
drifted awhile without sound.  Presently a red
crown of sparks sprang from the stack, and like
a thing alive it darted away down the sullen stream.
Hemming, Hicks, and Smith turned silently and
stole back to the deserted house.  During their short
absence, all the native servants had run away.
</p>

<p>
Smith, who seemed devoid of fear, buried the
dead trooper in the flower-bed upon which he had
fallen.  Doctor Scott joined the garrison toward
morning, and was both relieved and surprised to
find that the Tetsons had decamped safely.
</p>

<p>
"They are not dangerous now, except to property,"
he said.  "They may do a little accidental
shooting, of course, for the colonel is very drunk,
and down on you, Hemming, for spoiling his profitable
game.  That new chap seems to be quite off
his head.  Never heard such fool talk in all my life
as he is spouting."
</p>

<p>
"Did Santosa get away?" asked Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Two men went after him, and only one came
back, and he is in the hospital," replied the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Who looked after him?" inquired Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"I stitched him up before I came away," replied
Scott, casually.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br><br>
THE COLONEL'S ULTIMATUM
</h3>

<p>
The little garrison breakfasted before sunrise.
They had been busily occupied all night, securing
doors and windows against any sudden attack.
Smith made the secretary a huge bowl of beef tea,
much to that warlike invalid's disgust.
</p>

<p>
"See here, Smith," he said, "if I can fight, I
can eat."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Tetson's orders, sir," replied the man,
gravely.
</p>

<p>
The doctor laughed boisterously, and Hicks
blushed.  While Hemming and Scott devoured
boiled eggs, muffins; and coffee, with Smith waiting
on them with a revolver in his pocket, Hicks retired
to another room, out of sight of temptation.  The
poor fellow felt that seven eggs and a plate of
muffins would be as nothing in his huge emptiness.
He opened one of the upper front windows, and
knelt by the sill, rifle in hand.  His thoughts were
gloomy.  The beef tea had only sharpened his
appetite and dampened his spirits.  Outside, the dawn
was quickly strengthening, filling the beautiful
gardens with magic, inviting light.  He thought of
the little fountain in front of the bench, and of the
lonely crane.  Suddenly he heard the brisk padding
of hoofs on the drive, and the colonel, followed by
a trooper, rode up to the great steps.
</p>

<p>
With pardonable caution, Hicks protruded his
head from the window, and addressed the Brazilian
politely.
</p>

<p>
The stout horseman saluted, and spoke thus, in
what he fondly considered to be English: "SeÃ±or,
a good morning to you, my friend.  I here have a
letter, humbly which I wish a delivery in the hands
of General Hemming."
</p>

<p>
He smiled up at the man in the window, evidently
vastly pleased with his speech.  It was not often
that he attempted the language of these aliens.
</p>

<p>
"If you will kindly request the gentleman with
you to poke the letter under the door, I shall be
delighted to deliver it to the general," replied Hicks,
with a wan grin.
</p>

<p>
The colonel blinked sleepily, for he had been up
late, assisting at the writing of the letter, and
emptying bottles.  "Have no tremble, seÃ±or," he said,
"for see,&mdash;I am as a sheep, mild."
</p>

<p>
"I know nothing of sheep, colonel," replied
Hicks, "and all is not wool that looks greasy."  The
soldiers below looked puzzled, and Hicks felt sorry
that they were his only audience.  Presently the
colonel spoke to his man in Portuguese, and passed
him a long, white envelope.  The little trooper
advanced upon the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir," cried Hicks, and bowed, as
he turned from the window.  But the colonel called
him back.
</p>

<p>
"A moment, seÃ±or," he said; "I will inquire
of the conditions of the ladies, with most respectable
regards."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, they are very well," said Hicks,
and hurried away.
</p>

<p>
When Hicks gave the letter to Hemming, that
self-possessed gentleman and the doctor were
smoking, with their chairs pushed back, and Smith was
eating muffins with surprising rapidity.
</p>

<p>
"A letter to you?" queried Scott.  "Then they
must know of Tetson's escape."
</p>

<p>
"Possibly," said Hemming, and opened the paper.
At first he smiled, as he read.  Then, of a
sudden, he wrinkled his brows, stared, and looked
up.
</p>

<p>
"What is that stranger's name?" he asked,
sharply.
</p>

<p>
"Cuddlehead, sir," replied Smith, promptly.
</p>

<p>
"I doubt it," retorted the other, "for I have
reason enough to remember this handwriting."
</p>

<p>
To explain the remark, he opened the sheet on
the table, and pointed to where a line had been
crossed through and rewritten in a chirography very
different to that of the body of the manuscript.
</p>

<p>
"He seemed harmless enough, whoever he is,
from what I heard of him," remarked Hicks.
</p>

<p>
"He's a sneaking cad," said Hemming, hotly,
"and has more devil in him than you could find
in the whole of that rotten battalion put together.
His real name is Penthouse,&mdash;and, by gad, no
wonder he kept out of my sight!"
</p>

<p>
"May we read the letter?" asked the doctor,
calmly.
</p>

<p>
"Read away," said the commander-in-chief, and
got out of his chair to pace the room.
</p>

<p>
The style of the document disclosed its mongrel
extraction.  It ran as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"TO THE DISTINGUISHED SEÃ‘OR HERBERT
HEMMING, LATE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE
ARMY OF PERNAMBA.
</p>

<p>
"DEAR SIR:&mdash;We, the undersigned officers of
the Army of Pernamba (seeing in you the real
head of the presidential household), do hereby
request you to consider the following petitions.
First&mdash;We desire the sum of ten thousand dollars,
due us and our men, in back pay, as per signed
agreement with Mr. Tetson.  Second&mdash;We desire
an apology from your distinguished and august
self, due us for insulting words spoken to every
officer and man of this army.  Should the above
petitions not be granted within twenty-four hours,
we shall proceed, without further parley, to force
the money from Mr. Tetson and the apology from
you."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
At the foot of this ridiculous but disconcerting
epistle, stood the names of all the native officers,
except, of course, Captain Santosa.
</p>

<p>
The morning passed without disturbance.  The
brown soldiers moved about the fast-shut house,
smoking endlessly, and talking to one another.
The afternoon proved as unexciting as the
morning, and Smith began to long for a fight.  But
Hemming would not let him even take pot-shots
at the men in the grounds.  By the doctor's orders,
the secretary's diet was advanced to soft-boiled eggs.
By good luck a store of these were in the house,
all more or less fresh.
</p>

<p>
The colonel took up his position before the villa
bright and early on the morning of the 20th of
May.  It was quite evident to Hemming, who
watched him from an upper window, that he had
been drinking heavily.  Hemming was the first to
speak.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure you know what I want, seÃ±or," he
replied, in his own language.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Tetson and I have decided not to consider
your so-called petitions," said Hemming, quietly.
"We would prove ourselves cowards should we
do so.  Mr. Tetson owes you nothing,&mdash;in fact,
the debt is very much the other way; and I shall
never ask your pardon for having spoken the truth."
</p>

<p>
The colonel was furious.
</p>

<p>
"Consider the safety of the ladies," he shouted.
</p>

<p>
Scott, who stood behind Hemming, chuckled at
that.  "What wily, open-eyed chaps they are," he
said.  "I wonder if they have missed the steamer
yet?"
</p>

<p>
Hemming leaned from the window.  "We can
look after the ladies, thank you," he sneered, "and,
by the way, tell your precious English friend, who
helped you write that charming letter, that if I get
my hands on him, he'll suffer more than he did the
other time.  Hurry along now."
</p>

<p>
Hemming had recovered his monocle, and before
its baleful glare the colonel was silent and confused.
Just then Cuddlehead thumped into view, clinging
to the neck of Hemming's own white stallion.  He
was in a far worse state than the colonel even, and
swayed in the saddle.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Captain Hemming," he cried,
and waved his hand.
</p>

<p>
The men in the room were startled by the expression
that crossed their friend's face.  The mouth
hardened.  The eyes narrowed.  A deep flush burned
in his thin cheeks.  He paid no heed to the stranger's
salutation.
</p>

<p>
"Pepper," he said, softly.
</p>

<p>
The stallion looked up.
</p>

<p>
"What is that pitiful object on your neck?  That
nasty cad?"
</p>

<p>
Pepper hung his clever little head.
</p>

<p>
His master leaned far out of the window, and
his eyes met those of the little stallion.
</p>

<p>
"Pepper," he said, "jump."
</p>

<p>
Pepper jumped.  Cuddlehead slid over his tail,
and for a full minute remained seated in the dust.
The Brazilian colonel reeled in his saddle with
choking laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Good old horse, good Pepper," called
Hemming, gently.
</p>

<p>
The stallion cantered away, riderless.
</p>

<p>
The object of the colonel's uncomfortable mirth
got painfully to his feet.  His face was purple with
the fury that raged within him.  He cast discretion
to the winds, and, drawing a revolver, emptied
it at the smoking-room window.  He looked under
the cloud of dirty smoke, and saw Hemming's face
bent toward him, set and horrible.
</p>

<p>
"Go away," said a voice that rang like metal,
"or I will kill you where you stand.  You have
crossed my trail once too often, Penthouse, and, by
God! this will be the last time.  But now you may
go away, you poor fool."
</p>

<p>
Scott twitched once or twice, where he lay on
the smoking-room floor, with his head on Smith's
knee.
</p>

<p>
But he was dead, sure enough, with a hole in his
neck and another in his heart.
</p>

<p>
News of the doctor's death soon reached the
army, and the colonel's eyes were partially opened
to his foolishness.  He returned to his quarters,
and tried to drown his misgivings in drink.  Soon
he was as reckless and crazy as ever.  It was not a
game for a sober man to play with any chance of
success.  Penthouse, for it was really he, cursed
his luck when he heard of his deed, but not so much
in disgust at having killed a harmless stranger as
in having missed Hemming.  Then he steadied his
nerves with a glass of brandy, and encouraged the
army to fresh efforts.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon, Hemming opened the front
door, and stared at the men on the veranda.  His
left arm was in a sling.  The troopers straightened
up at sight of him, and one even went so far as to
toss away his cigarette.  The slim lieutenant, with
the weakness for golf, bowed low.
</p>

<p>
"While you are waiting for that money," said
Hemming, "will you be kind enough to ask some
of your men to dig a grave over there?"  He
pointed with his hand.  The lieutenant gave the
order.  Then he turned to Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"We regret the doctor's death," he said,
"but,&mdash;ah&mdash;well&mdash;the fortunes of war."
</p>

<p>
"You give this lawlessness rather a dignified
name," replied the Englishman.
</p>

<p>
A blush was all the Brazilian's answer.
</p>

<p>
"Do you want to kill us all, or is it only the
money you are after?" asked Hemming.
</p>

<p>
The lieutenant looked both ashamed and sulky.
He was handsome in a weak sort of way, with a
baby face and a thread of black moustache.  "We
want not to kill," he began, in stilted English, then
in his own tongue he continued, "We swore long
ago to stick together and hold to our plans,&mdash;all
except Captain Santosa.  We are poor, and one way
of making money seemed as good as another.  We
have our pride and our honour,&mdash;we officers.  You
insulted our colonel.  You have called us robbers.
Now we will humble your arrogance,&mdash;and get
our pay."
</p>

<p>
Hemming translated slowly, often having to hark
back to a word and feel around for its meaning.
The troopers, who had caught something of the
conversation, awaited the commander-in-chief's
reply in expectant attitudes.
</p>

<p>
"You have your pride," he said at last; "then,
for God's sake, take it away!  It reminds me of a
cur with a rotten bone.  And that murderer you
have with you, surely you are proud of him.  Humble
my arrogance if you can.  It will stand a lot of
that sort of thing."
</p>

<p>
He looked out to where three men were breaking
the sod for Scott's grave.
</p>

<p>
"How many of you has Doctor Scott nursed
back to worthless lives?" he asked.  The men
turned their faces toward the gravediggers.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br><br>
O'ROURKE TO THE RESCUE
</h3>

<p>
Penthouse (still known to the army as SeÃ±or
Cuddlehead) sat in the colonel's bedroom in an
unenviable frame of mind.  He had been a fool
to show himself to Hemming.  He had been a fool
to put any faith in these niggers.  Why, the little
cowards were afraid to break into the house,&mdash;afraid
to face five white men and a couple of women.
And now that Hemming had seen him again, and
again in a decidedly unfavourable light, what mercy
could he expect if Hemming ever got out of the
President's villa?  Whatever he could do must be
done quickly.  He looked at the colonel, who lay
in drunken half-slumber on the bed.
</p>

<p>
"You don't seem to be carrying out our plans,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
The Brazilian groaned, and muttered something
in his own tongue, which, fortunately, the other
could not translate.  "We must carry off the women
to-night.  Our chances of getting what we want
lessen every hour.  If help comes from the coast,
then what will happen?  Half a dozen men could
run your dirty army out of the country."  With
every unheeded word, Penthouse's anger grew.  The
colonel sprawled there, murmuring that he felt very
ill.  Penthouse jumped up and shook him violently.
</p>

<p>
"Wake up, you drunken hog!" he shouted;
"wake up, and get to work."
</p>

<p>
The colonel opened his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"The ladies&mdash;they are gone.  They went&mdash;long ago."
</p>

<p>
He closed his eyes again.
</p>

<p>
"You fool!" cried Penthouse, trembling with
rage and disappointment, "you fool, didn't I tell
you to put a guard on the boat, and to surround
the house?"
</p>

<p>
"The guard went&mdash;to Pedro's&mdash;to buy wine.
I did not hear till to-day.  I was angry," replied
the Brazilian, in a faint and broken voice.
</p>

<p>
"To buy wine," echoed the white man, in a
tragic cry.  Failure grinned at him again.  Even
in battle and murder he could not succeed.  He
almost found it in him to regret the vagrant, hungry
days on the London streets, when he went up and
down among familiar faces, tattered and disguised.
He was at home there, at least, and knew the tricks
of the place.  But here, hunted by Hemming for
a murderer, penniless, and among strangers,&mdash;Lord,
one would be better dead.
</p>

<p>
"Hemming must never get away from that
house," he whispered to himself.
</p>

<p>
The colonel snorted and choked in his heavy
sleep.  For a few minutes the broken Englishman
looked at him intently.  Then he walked over to
a small table by the window.  "There is still liquor
that I don't have to pay for," he said, and lifted
the bottle.
</p>

<p>
Through the President's gardens and the streets
of the little town, the troopers sauntered and
smoked, awaiting further orders from their colonel
for the undoing of the passive enemy.
</p>

<p>
"The colonel and SeÃ±or Cuddlehead are closeted
together," said a subaltern to a sergeant, "so before
dark we shall have our money."
</p>

<p>
"But the ladies have gone," replied the sergeant.
"They went away in the President's steamer while
the guard was shaking dice at Pedro's."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know that?" argued the officer.
"No one saw them go.  Of course they keep away
from the windows."
</p>

<p>
"The General Hemming would see that we got
our money, if the ladies were in any danger," said
the other, conclusively.  But the subaltern shook his
head.
</p>

<p>
"You don't know these fools of Englishmen as
well as I do," he said.  "They would rather have
their own grandmothers shot than pay out any
money."
</p>

<p>
"But," retorted the sergeant, with a knowing
look, "it is not the general's money we want, but
the President's.  He would force the old man to
pay, if the ladies were in peril.  No, the women have
gone with the steamer, I am sure."
</p>

<p>
"Englishmen are stubborn brutes," replied the
officer, unconvinced, "and besides, my friend, this
Hemming believes that with his own right arm
he is able to defend the house against us.  Also,
my friend, why should he give us Tetson's money
until we force him to?  It may all be his some day."
</p>

<p>
The besieged wondered why more shooting was
not done.  What fun could the little men find in
a smokeless revolution?  Did they still cling to the
hope of receiving back pay?  Did they still believe
the family to be in the villa?  Hemming, seated
by the window, with his rifle across his knees,
wondered when they would begin to humble his
arrogance.  Valentine Hicks, eating quinine and
prowling from room to room, and window to window,
with his Winchester under his arm, lived over and
over again his parting with Marion.  Smith, armed
like a pirate, and itching for a fight, was happier
than he had ever been.  He had a heavy strain of
the bulldog in him, had this valet named Smith, also
a fine respect for gentlemen, and a love of their
companionship.
</p>

<p>
It was dark in the gardens.  Smith was downstairs
in the billiard-room, motionless and wide
awake.  Hemming and Hicks were smoking, one
on each side of the upper hall window, which overlooked
the front steps, the driveway, and the great
gates.
</p>

<p>
"The poor fellows will be sadly disappointed
when they get in and find the Tetsons and the
money gone," remarked Hemming, calmly, "though
their stupidity in thinking them still here beats me."
</p>

<p>
"There are some things of value in the house,"
replied Hicks.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes; they might melt the silver," suggested
Hemming, "but the furniture would bother them.
Of course they will tear up the place, and pot us,
and try to get revenge that way."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Hicks, "but I have a little stone
about me."  He opened his linen tunic, and
unfastened a narrow cartridge-belt.  "I wear it next
my skin," he said, "and it galls me a bit
sometimes."  He drew a brass shell from one of the
loops and with his penknife extracted a cork and
a wad of cotton wool.  Then he shook something
white and rough, but glowing dimly, into the palm
of Hemming's hand.  He laughed softly.
</p>

<p>
"The bridegroom's gift to the bride," he
said,&mdash;"if the bridegroom gets to the church."
</p>

<p>
Hemming gazed at it in silence.
</p>

<p>
"Cut and polished, what would it be worth?"
asked its owner.  His voice was low and eager.  He
placed a trembling hand on his friend's knee.
</p>

<p>
"I have seen diamonds in the rough before,"
replied Hemming, "but never one as large as this.
Brazilian stones vary a good deal in quality.  It
may stand for a fortune, or perhaps for nothing
more than a respectable cottage, with stables, a
paddock, and an orchard, and maybe a shooting in
Scotland."
</p>

<p>
"That would do for us," said Hicks, grinning
like a schoolboy.  "Old Tetson could manage the
orchard, and Mrs. Tetson could see that he didn't
get his feet wet."  For a few moments he seemed
to be following this dream of bucolic bliss.
</p>

<p>
Then he continued: "I bought it in Pernambuco
last December from a drunken sailor, a cook or
something like that, who had run away from a
wind-jammer.  He didn't think much of it.  It had
been given him by an old woman,&mdash;at least, so he
said, but more likely he stole it.  I paid fifteen
<i>milreis</i> for it,&mdash;fifteen <i>milreis</i>, with the exchange
at ninepence."
</p>

<p>
"Put it away," said Hemming, "and keep that
belt next your hide, no matter how much it galls."
</p>

<p>
Hicks replaced the stone in the empty shell, and
the shell in his belt.
</p>

<p>
"And she thinks I haven't a cent," he whispered.
"Isn't she a brick?"
</p>

<p>
The Englishman leaned back, out of range of
the open window, and relit his cigar.  Suddenly
Hicks bent forward, listening.
</p>

<p>
"Did you hear that?" he said.
</p>

<p>
But Hemming had heard no unusual sound, only
the footsteps of their guards, and the noise of men
singing at the barracks.
</p>

<p>
"It's the first time I have heard an old 'Sam
Peabody' in Brazil," said the American.
</p>

<p>
"Who?" said Hemming, wondering if his
friend's temperature had gone up again.
</p>

<p>
"It's a bird, some sort of sparrow we have in
the North," replied Hicks.  He left the hall quietly,
and hung out of a window in his own room.
Presently, from the shrubbery below him, came the
familiar notes again.  He wet his lips with his
tongue, and whistled the clear call himself.  He
was answered immediately.  He peered down into
the dim garden.  The only light was that of the
stars.  He could see nothing.  No leaf stirred in
the shrubbery, and there was neither sight nor sound
of the enemy on that side of the house.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't intend to let us in," said a quiet
voice, "you might pass out a couple of drinks."
</p>

<p>
"Whiskey and soda for me," said the voice of
Captain Santosa.
</p>

<p>
Hicks ran down-stairs, and Hemming followed
him.  They unbarred a window, and Smith stood
ready with his rifle at port.  In crawled O'Rourke
and Santosa, very wet as to clothing, but very dry
inside.
</p>

<p>
"The Campbells have arrived," said O'Rourke,
brushing mud from his leggings.  Hemming, for a
moment, was dumbfounded at this unexpected
appearance.
</p>

<p>
"God bless you, Bertram," he said at last, and
they shook hands warmly.
</p>

<p>
"I thought, a few days ago, that it was chance
that brought me to Brazil," said O'Rourke, "but
really, little fellow, it must have been your guardian
angel.  What a chap you are for getting into silly
messes.  There seems to be a row whenever you
arrive."
</p>

<p>
"This row is not Hemming's fault," protested
Hicks.  O'Rourke and Hemming laughed happily,
for both felt that, together, they could pull out of
the worst scrape ever invented.
</p>

<p>
"This gentleman would come," said Santosa,
"and at a pace that nearly wore me to the bone."
</p>

<p>
Just then Smith held a tray toward the late arrivals.
</p>

<p>
"We left McPhey organizing a relief expedition
to come by land," O'Rourke informed them, after
quenching his thirst, "and the major, after doing
his business, will bring a party up by boat,&mdash;a
company or two of government troops."
</p>

<p>
"Where did you leave the horses?" asked Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Up the trail a little way, with a dusky admirer
of yours," replied O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
The besieged returned to the upper hall.  Hicks
gave a clear though somewhat lengthy account of
the rebellion.  Santosa told them of his ride to
Pernambuco and O'Rourke gave such news as he
could of the outside world.  Hemming, with his
eyes on the dark blue square of the window, tried
to formulate a plan by which five men might
protect themselves and the property against five
hundred a day or two longer.  He knew that, if the
colonel really intended violence, the crisis must soon
come.
</p>

<p>
Santosa kicked off his boots, and went to sleep
on the floor.  Hicks, seated with his rifle across his
knees, also slipped away to the land of Nod.
</p>

<p>
"If you have no objections," remarked O'Rourke,
"I will take a bath.  Hope the enemy won't make
any hostile move while I'm splashing."
</p>

<p>
Hemming lit another cigar, and continued his
watch by the open window.  His arm pained him
a good deal, so it was not hard to keep awake.
He heard the guards tramping about, and now and
then a few words of conversation, or a snatch of
laughter.  He heard music and shouting in the
distance, and sometimes the faint and hurried clatter
of hoofs.  All the windows in the town seemed
alight.  A cool wind stole across the palms.  His
thoughts left the foolish, drunken men without,
and the adventurers within, and journeyed, with
the wind, far beyond the black palms and the little
city.  The report of a rifle brought him to his feet
with a jump.  Hicks also was out of his chair.
Santosa was pulling on his boots.  They hurried
down-stairs followed by O'Rourke in a bath-towel.
</p>

<p>
"If it's a fight," said O'Rourke, "I'll dry myself
and join you.  If it's just skirmishing, I'll go back
to my tub."
</p>

<p>
They found Smith at his post in the billiard-room.
</p>

<p>
"What is the trouble?" asked Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Family quarrel, I believe, sir," replied the valet.
"Two people have been talking English for quite
awhile, just a little way off that window.  Then
some one fired a shot, and they dusted.  Think it
was one of the guards, sir, who fired.  Drunk, I
suppose."
</p>

<p>
"What were they talking about?" asked Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, I couldn't catch much of it," replied
Smith, "but there was something said about
Mr. Tetson's steamer, the <i>Alligator</i>, and about the
firemen and engineers being prisoners.  From what
I could gather, she was captured about half a mile
down-stream to-night on her way up.  One of the
men said that he had got a job on her, because he
had some important business to attend to up here."
</p>

<p>
"The devil!" exclaimed Hicks.  "I bet they
had a letter for me."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br><br>
THE UNEXPECTED SAILOR
</h3>

<p>
Morning came, and with it the colonel, on
Hemming's white stallion.
</p>

<p>
"I see," said he, in Portuguese, "that Captain
Santosa has returned."
</p>

<p>
Hemming nodded.  The colonel pressed a tremulous
hand to a flushed forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Damn it," he cried, "I would not have done so.
This place is the devil.  The ice factory has shut
down, and my drink has been warm for two days."
</p>

<p>
"Very interesting," replied the Englishman, "but
if you have nothing more important to tell me, you
will excuse me if I return to my bed."
</p>

<p>
The colonel raised his hand.
</p>

<p>
"One moment," said he.
</p>

<p>
Then he ordered his men out of ear-shot.  He
rolled a cigarette, and lit it with unseemly
deliberation.
</p>

<p>
"I have been remarkably polite and friendly," he
said, "but now I have your steamer, and the crew
in prison, and unless, my dear fellow, we can
agree&mdash;"  He stopped, and removed his hat, the
better to rub his brow.  Hemming yawned.
</p>

<p>
"The army," continued the Brazilian, "is in a
dangerous mood.  Unless you give me five thousand
<i>milreis</i> to-night,&mdash;only five thousand <i>milreis</i>,&mdash;I
fear that I can restrain my brave soldiers no longer.
But say nothing of it to SeÃ±or Cuddlehead."
</p>

<p>
"Give me time to shave," said Hemming, "and then&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And then?" asked the colonel.
</p>

<p>
"Why, and then," repeated Hemming, "tell the
little beasts not to be restrained any longer.  As
for the money&mdash;you may go to the devil for that."
</p>

<p>
The colonel sighed, and mopped his neck with his
wilted handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
"It is too warm to fight," he said.
</p>

<p>
"You will find it so," retorted the Englishman.
</p>

<p>
The colonel looked up helplessly.
</p>

<p>
"My army," he sighed, "how can I restrain it?
I hate to fight, and my head aches.  But my army
must have some money."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see my way to help you," said Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"The revolution is a failure unless you surrender
and pay," cried the colonel.  "Don't you understand,
my dear Hemming?  I do not like bloodshed,
but&mdash;well, you have ruined our gentler plan."
</p>

<p>
"You might carry away the table silver," replied
Hemming, "but there is no money.  That has all
gone to the coast.  No doubt the house and furniture,
and even the forks and spoons, belong by now to the
Brazilian government.  It would be foolish of you
to damage government property for the sake of a
few pounds.  It would mean trouble, my friend."
</p>

<p>
The colonel sagged in his saddle like a bag of
meal.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot argue," he said, listlessly.  "It is too
hot to talk.  My head aches&mdash;the devil take it.  You
should not have sent the money."
</p>

<p>
"A touch of sun," suggested Hemming.
</p>

<p>
The fat Brazilian looked at the blue sky through
bloodshot, half-closed eyes.
</p>

<p>
"The sun," he said, "why, yes, the sun.  Damn
the sun."
</p>

<p>
He swayed for a moment, and then slid in a heap
to the ground.  His men had been watching him,
and now two of them ran forward and carried the
yielding, flabby body to the nearest fountain.
</p>

<p>
"Sun and whiskey," commented Hemming.  Then
he returned to his bedroom and commenced to shave.
</p>

<p>
By this time the little garrison was astir.  Hicks,
with a sandwich in one hand and his rifle in the
other, opened the shutters of one of the lower
windows and looked out.  Not ten feet away stood a
man in a blue cotton shirt, and dirty canvas trousers.
The blotchy, grinning face and bowed legs struck
him with an unpleasant sense of familiarity.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, mister," said the stranger.  "I'd like to
'ave a word wid one of you gents."
</p>

<p>
"Which one?" asked Hicks.
</p>

<p>
"There you 'ave me," replied the man.  "Ye see,
I was drunk an' it were a dark night.  Don't know
as I'd know 'im widout puttin' a few questions."  He
took a couple of steps toward the open window.
Hicks put the remaining portion of the sandwich
into his mouth, and shifted the rifle.
</p>

<p>
"Ease off that thar gun a p'int or two," cried the
sailor.
</p>

<p>
Hicks had been taught, while young, not to talk
with his mouth full.  So he made no answer.
</p>

<p>
"I ain't looking fer no trouble," said the seaman.
"All I want is ter come aboard an' 'ave a quiet jaw
wid you and yer mates, afore this blasted old craft
'awls down 'er colours."
</p>

<p>
"What about?" asked Hicks.
</p>

<p>
"That thar dimund, skipper," replied the man,
with an evil grin.
</p>

<p>
Hicks changed colour.  O'Rourke stuck his head
out of the window.  He glared at the man in the
blue shirt for several seconds.
</p>

<p>
"Belay that talk," he said, "and stop up the slack
of it neat and shipshape."
</p>

<p>
The man of the sea rolled his eyes in pained
astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"So it was you, Mr. O'Rourke," he sneered.
"Now that's a gentleman's trick for you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it was I kicked you down the hatch, if that
is what you are mentioning," replied O'Rourke,
"and I think you know enough of me to obey my
orders on the jump.  I've eaten enough of your
slush-fried grub to kill a whole ship's crew, you
thieving sea-cook.  I know you for too big a coward
to step out on to the foot-rope, but brave enough
to jab a marlinspike between a mate's ribs.  So
clear out of this."
</p>

<p>
The seaman shuffled his feet and grinned.
</p>

<p>
"Not so quick," he retorted; "'and over that
dimund an' I'll go, Mister O'Rourke."
</p>

<p>
"Diamond, you longshore gallows-bird, I don't
know what you are talking about, but I'll hand
over something that'll make you hop, in a minute,"
cried O'Rourke, in a fury.
</p>

<p>
Hicks threw his Winchester to his shoulder.
"Come right in," he said, "or I'll blow the third
button of your dirty shirt, counting from the top,
right through your chest."
</p>

<p>
The seaman pulled a hideous face, and spat into
the dust.
</p>

<p>
"Guess I'll accept your kind invite," he said.
"It's real civil of gents like you to treat a poor
sailorman like this."  But he did not move.
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke eyed him with a new interest, and Hicks
squinted along the black barrel.
</p>

<p>
"Don't trouble about that knife.  We will lend
you one if we keep you to lunch," said O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
The fellow's face widened in a sickly smile as he
entered the billiard-room by way of the open
window.  After relieving him of an amazingly sharp
sheath-knife, they tied his hands and feet and locked
him safe in an empty room.
</p>

<p>
"You see, O'Rourke, I am the man he is after;
I have the diamond he talks about," explained Hicks.
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke whistled softly, and smiled inquiringly
at the big fever-thinned secretary.
</p>

<p>
"Take it from him?" he queried.
</p>

<p>
"I bought it from him," replied Hicks, "and it's
on me now."
</p>

<p>
"Hold on to it, then, old chap," said O'Rourke,
"and don't gab.  He hates me, anyway, so he may
just as well keep on thinking I have the stone.  He
was cook aboard a barquentine in which I made a
voyage last year.  I was a passenger,&mdash;the skipper's
friend,&mdash;and when the skipper was sick I had to
interview the cook once or twice."
</p>

<p>
The colonel died that evening, at a quarter past
six, of too much rum and whiskey and not enough
medical treatment.  His soldiers had done their best
to save his life.  Three of them, with the best
intentions, held him upside down in a fountain for a good
fifteen minutes, at the very beginning of his illness.
Then they had carried him to his own quarters, and
watched him expire.
</p>

<p>
The SeÃ±or Cuddlehead now took command, for
the officers were in a funk.  Through an interpreter
he lectured and encouraged the men.  He assured
them that, should Hemming escape from the house
alive, they would all swing for it, sooner or later;
and that should they capture and bear away the
other inmates, every man would find himself rich.
What matter if the ladies had escaped, he
said&mdash;surely the friends of Mr. Hicks would gladly pay
a great ransom, should they succeed in carrying him
away to the hills.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br><br>
THE ATTACK
</h3>

<p>
When news of the colonel's death reached
Hemming, he sighed with relief.
</p>

<p>
"That ends it," he said.  "The old man was a
fool, but he held them together."
</p>

<p>
"What about that Penthouse-Cuddlehead chap?
He seems to be taking an interest in it," said Hicks.
</p>

<p>
"He is sneak enough for anything, but he is also
a coward," replied Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"This is a poor sort of revolution," said
O'Rourke.  "I have had more excitement waiting
for my mail at the window of a country post-office.
A Sunday-school treat beats it hands down.  Davis
could invent a better one in his sleep."
</p>

<p>
"Please don't talk like an ass, old chap," said
Hemming.  He found the revolution quite exciting
enough.
</p>

<p>
"I shall go and look at my prisoner&mdash;he may be
in a better humour than you," remarked O'Rourke,
pensively.
</p>

<p>
Hicks followed him to the door of the locked
room.
</p>

<p>
"These duffers don't want to fight.  They never
did, either.  It was all a bluff of the colonel's," he
said.
</p>

<p>
The other shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Wait until we hear from Hemming's enemy.  I
think he'll take a turn before we get out of this," he
replied.  "He has played poor old Hemming some
low tricks before now," he added, and gave Hicks a
hint of the trouble in Hemming's past.  Hicks passed
on and descended to the billiard-room, and O'Rourke
paused at the door.  He turned the key and stepped
into the room.  He dodged before his eyes had
warned him of danger.  The huge fist landed on a
point of his left shoulder, and sent him spinning
across the room.  He recovered himself in time to
partially evade the seaman's bull-like rush.
Staggered and hurt, he closed with his antagonist,
wondering dully if the fellow had broken the cords, or
had worked the knots loose.  It did not occur to
him to call for help.  The door had closed behind
him.  The mariner's huge arms seemed to force his
very heart out of its place.  The bowed, sturdy legs
wrenched at his knees.  The hot, evil breath burned
against his neck.  For a moment the pain of it closed
his eyes.  He was bent nearly double, and pin-points
of light flashed in his brain.  Then he recovered his
wits and his courage.  He twisted himself so that
his shoulder caught the sailor's chin.  This gave him
a chance to breathe, and eased the crushing weight
upon his ribs.  It was O'Rourke's belief that, in a
rough and tumble fight, without knives, and muscles
being equal, the gentleman has always the advantage
of the plebeian.  So once again he settled himself
to prove it.  But this time the plebeian was unusually
desperate.  He wanted a diamond, and he hated the
man his hands were upon.  All his superiors were
detestable to his uncouth soul.  He had feared
O'Rourke before this.  Now he felt no fear&mdash;only
a mad desire to knock the breath out of that well-kept
body, and mark with blood the hard-set, scornful
face.  Then for the coast again, with the stone
of fabulous price.  For a minute or two O'Rourke
played a waiting game.  Twice, by his quickness and
length of leg, he avoided a bad throw.  His back
and neck had some close calls.  After discovering
that he was in better condition than his opponent,
he began to force matters.  Within ten minutes of
his entrance, he knelt upon the sailor's bulky shoulders,
and with colourless lips muttered strange oaths.
Though his eyes were bright, he was not nice to
look at.
</p>

<p>
The original savage glared exultingly from that
white face.  The sailor lay still, with blood from lips
and nose staining the floor, a pitiful and ungainly
figure.
</p>

<p>
Presently O'Rourke got to his feet and staggered
from the room.  Smith caught him just in time to
help him to a chair.  It had been a big effort for
a warm day.
</p>

<p>
Hicks nursed the mariner back to his miserable
existence.  This required only a few minutes, for
brandy had an almost magic effect upon this outcast
of the sea.  He emptied one decanter, and, seeing
no chance of a second, made a dash for the
open window, taking the sill in a flying jump.  But
the window was on the second floor.  When Smith
went out to look at the body there was no trace
of it.
</p>

<p>
"I could have sworn," said Hicks, with a shudder,
"that I heard his neck break, but maybe it was just
the bushes giving way."
</p>

<p>
The night was bright with stars.  The little
garrison sat up and smoked by the open windows.  On
the lower floor, windows were shuttered and barred,
and doors were locked.  If this game of war were
worth playing at all, it was worth playing well.
Shortly before midnight some one staggered up to
the front of the house, carrying a paper lantern at
the end of a stick, and singing.  The guards jeered
him.  It was the sea-cook, drunk and bedraggled.
He stopped his song in the middle of a line, and
waved his lantern toward the window above him.
</p>

<p>
"Come out," he bawled, "an' gimme that dimund.
Gesh you thought I couldn't jump out er
that windy, didn't yer?  Gesh yer'll be jumpin' outa
it yerself perty soon."
</p>

<p>
The lantern caught fire, and the gaudy paper globe
went up in a little burst of flame.  The man threw
it from him, and lurched on to the veranda.  A
scattered volley broke, here and there, from the
garden.  A few bullets pinged into the woodwork
of the windows.  Shouts of laughter went up from
the clusters of trees and shrubs.  The sailor
hammered the front door.  The guards sneaked away
into the friendly shadows.
</p>

<p>
"They are all drunk," said Hicks, "and they'll
try to rush us, for sure."
</p>

<p>
"Then the colonel's death was not an unmixed
blessing," remarked O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
Hemming ordered Smith and Hicks to windows
on the other side of the house.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we shoot over their heads, or may we
pump it right into them?" asked Hicks.
</p>

<p>
"I leave it to your own discretion," replied
Hemming.
</p>

<p>
Smith grinned.  He promised himself an easy
interpretation of the word.
</p>

<p>
Hemming took the window in the upper hall,
overlooking the front steps and the driveway, himself.
</p>

<p>
There was not a figure in sight.  But the glass of
the window lay broken on the floor, and the
diamond-hunter kept up his drunken disturbance on the
veranda below.  The firing out of the shadows
continued, and drew nearer.  Hemming extinguished his
cigar and sat on the floor.  He enjoyed quite a novel
sensation when a bullet sang its way through the
open window, like a great bee, and ripped into a shelf
full of books half-way down the hall.  He had never
before been under fire behind a window.  All about
him he could hear the thumping of bullets against
the tiles of the outer walls.  Some one shouted in
English, ordering the drunken sailor to come away
from the house.
</p>

<p>
"Yer want my dimund, that's wot yer want," he
shouted back, "but yer don't get so much ash a
peep at it, see?"
</p>

<p>
Hemming heard and frowned, as he polished his
eye-glass on his sleeve.  Two shots sounded in quick
succession from a room on the left of the hall.
Hemming heard Santosa laugh, and O'Rourke
congratulate him.  The firing now seemed to centre
mostly upon the front of the villa.  Hemming, as
yet, had not returned a shot.  Suddenly the white
man, moved by a drunken whim, left his hammering
at the door, and pranced into the starlight.  The
shooting of his friends was everywhere.  Elevation
had little attention from them, and an unusually low
ball found him out.  He did not spring forward with
uplifted hands; neither did he clutch at his breast
and stagger onward.  With an expression of pained
astonishment on his face, and a heave of his fat
shoulders, he sank to his hips, and then rolled over
and lay still.  To Hemming, it looked as if his fat
legs had simply crumpled under him like paper.
</p>

<p>
A dozen men charged across the starlit driveway.
Hemming dropped two of them.  The others ran
up the steps and across the veranda, and threw
themselves against the door.  But they were small
men, and the door was a heavy one, and well bolted.
Hemming left the window, and at the head of the
stairs met O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
"A brace and a half to me," said that gentleman,
lightly.
</p>

<p>
The bitter smoke drifted from doorway to
doorway through the dark.  Hemming got his sword
from his bedroom, and he and O'Rourke waited at
the top of the stairs.
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke's heart was glad within him.  Shoulder
to shoulder with a man like Hemming, it would be
a lovely fight.  The door could not give in soon
enough to suit him.  He had ten shots in his
revolvers.  Then he could break a few heads with his
clubbed rifle, surely, and, after that, when they had
him down, he could kick for awhile.  He did not
think of his parents in the North, his friends, his
half-written articles, nor his creditors.  But he was
sorry that Miss Hudson would never hear of his
heroic finish.
</p>

<p>
"We have had some fun together, and I hope this
will not be the last," said Hemming.  They shook
hands.  Then the door came in with a rending,
sidelong fall.  A bunch of men sprang across it and
made for the staircase, just discernible to them by
the light from the doorway.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-240"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-240.jpg" alt="&quot;THE DOOR CAME IN WITH A RENDING, SIDELONG FALL&quot;">
<br>
&quot;THE DOOR CAME IN WITH A RENDING, SIDELONG FALL&quot;
</p>

<p>
"Fire into the brown," said Hemming, quietly.
</p>

<p>
The four revolvers jumped and spit&mdash;once&mdash;twice&mdash;and
the wounded slipped back against their
comrades' legs.  More men entered the hall below,
and filed wildly into the darkness above and around.
Then Hicks, Santosa, and Smith left their windows
and pumped lead into the housebreakers.  The noise
was deafening.  The air was unfit to breathe.
O'Rourke wondered at something hot and wet
against his leg.  Hemming was angry because none
would come within cutting distance.  Smith felt very
sick, but did not mention the fact.  He knelt against
the bannisters, and fumbled with the hammer of his
revolver, and the blood from a great furrow in his
neck ran down one of the polished rounds that
supported the carved hand-rail.  But it was dark,
and he could not see it.  But presently he dropped
his revolver and felt the blood with his fingers, and
wondered, in a dim way, who it was dared to make
such a mess in Mr. Tetson's house.
</p>

<p>
The firing outside the house, which had died away
for a minute, increased suddenly, and cries of
warning and consternation rang above it.  More men
came to the open doorway.  They were armed with
rifles instead of the short carbines of the Pernamba
army.  They discharged a volley or two into the
backs of the scrambling soldiers on the stairs.
</p>

<p>
"That ends the revolution," remarked Hemming,
calmly, removing his monocle from his eye.
</p>

<p>
"I think we could have done it without help," said
Santosa.
</p>

<p>
The men on the stairs cried for mercy.
</p>

<p>
"Are you all safe, up there?" asked a voice from
the door.
</p>

<p>
Smith clung to the rounds of the bannisters and
closed his eyes, and O'Rourke leaned against the
wall with one knee drawn up.
</p>

<p>
"The same leg," he muttered, and twisted his
face at the pain of it.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br><br>
REST IN PERNAMBUCO
</h3>

<p>
Miss Tetson and Mr. Valentine Hicks were married
in the little English church in Pernambuco.  The
ex-President gave the bride away, the
ex-commander-in-chief supported the groom, and the major
supported the clergyman officiating.  Mrs. McPhey
supplied the wedding breakfast, and McPhey made all
the speeches.  Then the Tetsons and Hicks sailed
away for New York, leaving Herbert Hemming to
nurse Mr. O'Rourke and Smith.
</p>

<p>
The invalids were housed in cool rooms in the
McPhey mansion, on the outskirts of the city, and
they and Hemming were guests of honour for as
long as they would stay in the country.
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke's leg was in a bad way, but poor Smith's
neck was in a worse.  For the first week of his
attendance the clever American surgeon who had
them both in charge felt anxious enough for the
valet's life.  But modern methods and unflagging
care won the day, and a wound that, in the time
of the Crimean War, meant certain death, left
nothing but a sunken white scar.
</p>

<p>
A couple of months passed quietly.  Hemming
worked at a series of short stories, and learned the
gaudy-coloured, easy-going city by heart.  He
received several letters from Hicks, and heard that
the diamond had been sold at a good price.
O'Rourke pulled on his riding-boots again, and
exercised McPhey's stable, night and morning.
</p>

<p>
Hemming's white stallion was once more an inmate
of this stable.  Smith recovered his strength
slowly, and spent his days in easeful meditations and
unnamed regrets for the good time of fighting and
comradeship.
</p>

<p>
One day, Captain Santosa (who, through the
influence of McPhey and the major, had procured a
commission in the cavalry regiment stationed in
Pernambuco) brought news of Penthouse's death to
Hemming.  Penthouse had been found in a dying
condition in the hut of a poor woman, on the trail
above Pernamba, by a party of government troops.
He had been shot during the attack upon the President's
villa, and, crawling away from the fight, had
been found by the peasant woman, and tended by
her through his weeks of suffering.  She had
explained to the officer in command that an
Englishman had been kind to her, and for his sake she had
housed and nursed this other Englishman.  Thus,
through Hemming's kindness, had his enemy
received kindness.

<h2>PART THREE</h2>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
THE REAL GIRL
</h3>

<p>
Hemming and O'Rourke, with Smith as valet-in-common,
reached New York in November, and shivered
in their tropical underclothes.  The dismal aspect
of the great city, as viewed at nine o'clock of
a drizzly morning, daunted even the valet.  At sight
of the wide, wet streets and soaring office buildings,
depressing memories of Dodder's death came to
Hemming.  The chill brought a twinge to O'Rourke's
leg, and the swinging, clanging cars and hustling
crowds offended his sense of the fitness of things.
</p>

<p>
In a four-wheeler they went direct to a bachelor
apartment-house on Washington Square, in which
their friend, Mr. Valentine Hicks, had engaged for
them an airy suite of rooms.  As they passed under
the white archway, entering the old square, their
moods lifted.
</p>

<p>
"I believe I'll feel all right, when I get into a
woollen undershirt," said O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
Hemming soon settled down to his work.  He
was more systematic about it than O'Rourke, working
several hours every morning at articles for the
magazines, and part of every evening at a novel.
O'Rourke, who had many friends and acquaintances
in and about Newspaper Row, spent but little of his
time at home, and did his work when he had to.
Both O'Rourke and Hemming were frequent visitors
at another house on the square, where the Hickses
and Tetsons lived in comfort.  Hemming's novel
was built up, chapter by chapter, and relentlessly
torn down, only to be rebuilt with much toil.  The
general outline of the story had come to him years
before, one night while he was playing poker in the
chart-room of an ocean tramp.  He had written a
few pages next morning, behind the canvas dodgers
of the bridge.  Then it had been pushed aside by the
press of other work; but he had returned to it now
and then, in many parts of the world.  The chapters
done in Pernamba were the only ones that did not
seem to require rewriting.  By this time the original
plot was almost forgotten, and a more satisfactory
one had developed.
</p>

<p>
One Thursday night, having finished the twentieth
chapter as well as he knew how, he changed his
clothes and went over to call on Mrs. Hicks.  It
was her evening.  He went alone, for O'Rourke had
dined out, and had not returned.  About a dozen
people were already there.  While he was talking
to McFarland of the Gazette, he noticed a girl talking
to their hostess.  Just why she attracted him he
could not say for a moment.  Mrs. Hicks was more
beautiful, and there were at least two women in the
room as tastefully gowned.  She looked girlish
beside her stately hostess.  But there was a jaunty,
gallant air about the carriage of her head and
shoulders, which seemed to Hemming particularly
charming.  Her voice was deep, and her laughter was
unaffected as that of a boy.
</p>

<p>
"You too?" laughed McFarland.
</p>

<p>
"I never saw her before," said Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Then let me tell you now," said the editor, "that
it is no use.  Even your eye-glass could not awaken
her from her romantic dream."
</p>

<p>
"Count me out," replied Hemming, dryly, "but
tell me something about it."
</p>

<p>
"All I know," said McFarland, "is that there are
ten of us&mdash;eleven counting the lucky unknown.  We
ten used to hate one another, but now we are as
brothers in our common misery.  But tell me, is it
true that you are working on a novel?  I don't see
what you want to go messing with fiction for, when
you can do stuff like that Turkish book."
</p>

<p>
While Hemming and the journalist chatted
aimlessly in Mrs. Hicks's drawing-room, O'Rourke
made history across the square.  He had returned to
his quarters only a few minutes after his friend had
left; and had scarcely got his pipe well lighted when
Smith announced "a gentleman to see Captain
Hemming, very particularly."  O'Rourke got to his feet
and found the gentleman already at the sitting-room
door.  The caller was in evening clothes.  His ulster
hung open, and in his hand he carried an opera-hat.
</p>

<p>
"Hemming is out for the evening," said
O'Rourke, "but perhaps I can give him your
message.  Come in, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
The stranger entered and sat down by the fire.
He glanced about the walls of the room, and then
fixed an intent, though inoffensive, gaze on
O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
"I heard, only this morning, that Hemming was
in town," he said.  "We saw a good deal of each
other, once, in Porto Rico."
</p>

<p>
"In Porto Rico?" exclaimed O'Rourke, knitting
his brows.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Have you ever been there?"
</p>

<p>
"No, though I've sampled most of the islands.
But go on&mdash;I interrupted you.  I beg your pardon."
</p>

<p>
"Don't speak of it.  I only came for the address
of a friend of Hemming's.  But perhaps you could
tell me in what quarter of the globe Mr. O'Rourke
hangs out?  He's a literary chap, and maybe you
know him."
</p>

<p>
"Bertram St. Ives O'Rourke?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know him.  He is in town just now, at
206 Washington Square."
</p>

<p>
"Why, that must be very near here."
</p>

<p>
"It is," replied O'Rourke, with a strange light in
his eyes and a huskiness in his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Let me see," mused the other, "this is the
Wellington, number two hundred and&mdash;Lord, this
is the place."
</p>

<p>
His dark face paled suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"My name is O'Rourke," remarked the big man
with the pipe.
</p>

<p>
"And mine is Ellis," said the other.
</p>

<p>
They eyed each other squarely for several seconds.
</p>

<p>
"I have heard of you," said O'Rourke, in modulated
tones.  But all the while the blood was singing
in his ears, and splashing wisps of light crossed
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"And I of you," replied Ellis, quietly.  He had
not yet regained his colour.  O'Rourke, outwardly
calm, turned in his chair and searched among the
papers on the table.  He found a leather cigar-case,
opened it, and extended it to his visitor.
</p>

<p>
"Try one of these.  We like them immensely,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
Now the red surged into Ellis's face, and he
hesitated to receive the cigar.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know&mdash;how I have treated you?"
he whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Please try a smoke&mdash;and then tell me why you
came for my address.  The past is done with.  I am
only afraid of the future now."
</p>

<p>
Ellis drew the long black weed from the extended
case, and deliberately prepared it for smoking.
When it was burning to his satisfaction, he said:
</p>

<p>
"Do you know where the Hickses live?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Hemming is there to-night."
</p>

<p>
"So is Miss Hudson," remarked Ellis.
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke jumped from his chair, and grasped the
other by both hands.  Then he dashed into his
bedroom and shouted for Smith.  When he was
half-dressed he remembered that he had forgotten to ask
any questions, or even to be excused, while he
changed his clothes.  He looked into the sitting-room.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive my bad manners, Mr. Ellis.  You see
I'm in rather a rush," he said, gaily.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, certainly," exclaimed Ellis, starting up from
a gloomy contemplation of the fire.  He crossed over
and smiled wanly at O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't mind," he said, "I wish you'd keep
quiet about my part in&mdash;in this affair.  She would
despise me, you know&mdash;and I couldn't stand that."
</p>

<p>
"But I can tell her about to-night&mdash;about your
kindness," suggested O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
Ellis shook his head and smiled bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"She may not look at it in so charitable a light
as you do," he replied, "so please put it all down
to chance.  She does not know that I have ever
heard of you, except from her."
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke promised, and, after shaking hands,
Ellis left his rival to complete his toilet.  This he
did in short order.
</p>

<p>
To return to the drawing-room across the square.
By degrees Hemming drifted half around the room,
and at last found himself against the wall, between
the door from the hallway and the table containing
the punch-bowl.
</p>

<p>
He was feeling a bit weary of it all, and sought
refreshment in the bowl.  He had almost decided to
go home, when the door at his elbow opened, and to
his surprise O'Rourke entered, resplendent in white
breast, black tails, and eager smile.  This comrade
tried and true passed him without a glance&mdash;worse
still, strode between his host and hostess without a
sign of recognition.  Glass in hand, and monocle
flashing, Hemming wheeled and stared after him.
Others looked in the same direction.  Valentine and
Marion smiled sheepishly at their empty, extended
hands.  But the lady of the gallant, shapely shoulders
and unaffected laughter faced the late arrival
with the most wonderful expression in the world on
her face.  For a moment she seemed to waver.  Then
strong hands clasped hers.
</p>

<p>
"Bertram," she sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest&mdash;am I too late?"
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;oh, what do you mean?  See, they are
all looking."
</p>

<p>
"I love you.  Didn't I ever tell you?  And I have
searched the world for you."
</p>

<p>
"Hush&mdash;see, they are all staring at us.  Oh,
stop, or I shall certainly cry."
</p>

<p>
She snatched her hands away from his eager
grasp.
</p>

<p>
"But tell me," he begged, in a whisper, before
she could turn away.  For a wonderful second their
eyes read what the years of longing had set behind
the iris for love to translate.  Then she bowed her
face, and answered "Yes."
</p>

<p>
He did not know if she shouted it, or but murmured
it beneath her breath; it rang through his
body and spirit like the chiming of a bell.
</p>

<p>
"Drag me away," he whispered to Hicks.  "I
don't want to make an ass of myself before all these
people."
</p>

<p>
"You've done that already.  Come into my
study," said Hicks.
</p>

<p>
Hemming, scenting the truth, followed them.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter with you?" asked Hicks.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know your friends?  Is that the real
girl?" asked Hemming.
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke ignored the questions.
</p>

<p>
"Give me a drink of something," he said, and,
recovering a little of his composure, smote Hemming
violently on the back.
</p>

<p>
"Is it the real girl?" repeated Hemming, staggering.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I'd make a mistake?" cried the
lover.  He swallowed the brandy brought him by
Hicks, and requested a cigarette.  Their host
supplied it from a tin box on the mantelpiece, all the
while eyeing O'Rourke anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth made you act like that?" he
asked.  "There'll be wigs on the green when Marion
gets hold of you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you must forgive him this time," laughed
Hemming.  "For, as far as I can gather, he has
just met the lady of his heart after years of
separation."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean Miss Hudson?  Why, where did
you ever meet her?" cried Hicks.
</p>

<p>
"It's a long story," replied O'Rourke, "but perhaps
Herbert will tell it to you&mdash;I can't spare the
time."
</p>

<p>
He threw the half-smoked cigarette into the grate,
and left the study, closing the door behind him.
</p>

<p>
Hicks glanced uneasily at Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"I hope O'Rourke is not drunk," he said.  "An
out and out city square poet, who stays at home and
writes about the rolling billows, I can understand,
but I never know what chaps like you and O'Rourke
are up to."
</p>

<p>
Hemming laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry about O'Rourke," he said.
</p>

<p>
Later in the evening Hemming found a gray-haired
gentleman standing alone, lost in contemplation
of a black and white hunting picture.  He
seemed dazed, and ill at ease.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hemming," he said, "my name is Hudson,
and my daughter has just introduced me to a
Mr. O'Rourke.  Have you ever met him?"
</p>

<p>
"Several times," replied Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"A gentleman, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly."
</p>

<p>
"A man of property?"
</p>

<p>
"Inconsiderable."
</p>

<p>
"An adventurer, perhaps?"
</p>

<p>
"Just as I am."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear sir, your connections and your
reputation as a writer places you above suspicion.  I
had frequently heard of you before the Pernamba
episode."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Hemming, with a crispness
in his voice.
</p>

<p>
"But this man O'Rourke?" continued the other.
</p>

<p>
"O'Rourke," said Hemming, "lacks neither personal
distinction nor respectable family connections.
I have watched him under the most trying circumstances,
and his behaviour has always been above
criticism.  Also, he happens to be my dearest friend."

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
A NEW RESTLESSNESS
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "All night long, in the dark and wet,<br>
  A man goes riding by." ... R.L.S.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
During the first few days following O'Rourke's
sensational meeting with Miss Hudson, Hemming
saw very little of that headstrong young man, for
the lover spent his afternoons and evenings in
making up for lost time, and his mornings in rearing
Spanish castles.  At first Hemming took joy in his
friend's happiness&mdash;then came envy, and bleak
disgust at his own case.  He sought refuge in hard
work, and toiled every morning with a half-heart
for the subject in hand, and ears pricked up for
O'Rourke's babble of joy and content.  And behold,
at the end of a morning's grind, twenty pages for
the fire.  Even his novel came to a standstill.  The
chapter of romance, which had the joyful meeting
of O'Rourke and Miss Hudson for its inspiration,
seemed to have no connection with the rest of the
narrative, and no excuse for existence save its own
beauty.  He wondered if this chapter were a story
in itself&mdash;a breath of life's real poetry, too fine
and rare for marketing.  One night, alone in the
sitting-room brooding above the manuscript, he tried
to rewrite it in verse.  A new restlessness had him
by the heart, lifting him, one moment, to the heights
of confidence, only to drag him down, the next, to
the depths of uncertainty and longing.  Three lines
pulsed up to his brain, and he wrote them down.
Then he opened his sitting-room window and looked
out.  The lights in the square gleamed down on the
wet pavement.  The black tree-tops threshed in the
wind.  A cab sped down from Fifth Avenue, under
the arch.  A policeman paused beneath him, and
yawned at the bright entrance.
</p>

<p>
Hemming sniffed the wind, and decided to go
for a walk.  He circled the square three times.
Then he struck up Fifth Avenue, with his hands in
the pockets of his mackintosh and his stick under his
arm.  The big old houses on each side of the avenue
wore an air of kindness that was not for him.  Lights
were in the upper windows of most of them.  One
was still awake, and carriages waited in a solemn
row at the curb.  It seemed to Hemming that all
the world but himself was at peace.  The coachmen
and footmen waited contentedly outside, while their
masters and mistresses laughed and danced within.
What had these people to do with the bitterness of
the unattainable?  His eyes were turned in upon his
own heart, and nothing seemed real but this new
restlessness, this nameless desire like a crying in the
dark.  It was not for fame, nor altogether for the
power of expression, though that, at one time or
another, will tear the heart of every artist.  It was
not bred of any regret for the past, nor inspired by
apprehension for the future.  On the fly-leaf of a
friend's book he had once read the words, "There
is only the eternal now&mdash;an oasis of fleeting
actuality between two deserts of mirage."  Now he
remembered the words as he strolled up Fifth
Avenue.  The Eternal Now!  Could it give him no more
solace than this?  For him would it be always this
empty room, from the windows of which he might
look backward upon one mirage and forward to
another?  He felt in his pockets for something to
smoke.  They were empty, so he decided to keep
on until he could find a tobacconist's establishment.
Deep in thought, buffeted and yet soothed by the
bleak wind, he strode along, with little heed to his
course.  Presently, upon glancing up, he found
himself on a side street, before the area railings of a
basement restaurant that he knew well.  Here he
could get a Porto Rican cigar to which he was
particularly partial, or cigarettes of pungent tobacco
rolled in sweet brown paper.  He opened the iron
gate, descended the steps, and rang the signal of the
initiated on the bell.  The Italian woman opened the
door, and smilingly admitted him.  In the larger of
the two dining-rooms only one table was occupied,
for stray customers were not welcomed after the
regular dinner hours.  At the table sat two men
whom Hemming knew, and one who was a stranger
to him.  They were drinking coffee and smoking,
and from a chafing-dish in the centre of the table
drifted an odour with a tang to it.
</p>

<p>
Upon Hemming's entrance, Potts, assistant editor
of a ten-cent magazine, called to him to join them.
The Englishman did so, gladly.  Akerly, the
illustrator, he knew, and he was introduced to the third,
a thick-shouldered, blond-haired youth, by name
Tarmont.  Tarmont also proved to be an artist.  He
was a Canadian by birth, and had just arrived in
New York from a two years' visit in England.
</p>

<p>
"I was staying in Norfolk awhile," he said, "with
some cousins, and I met a friend of yours."  He
looked intently at Hemming as he spoke, and
Hemming started eagerly in his chair.  But in a moment
he sat quiet again.
</p>

<p>
"More than one, for that matter," continued
Tarmont.  "There was Major Anderson,&mdash;he talked
a great deal of you one night, after some one had
mentioned wars, and that sort of thing,&mdash;-and there
was an old chap who argued about you with an
old dame, the same evening.  Really, your memory
seemed to bulk large in their eyes."  He paused,
and smiled at his companions.  "Oh, I forgot," he
added; "there was a lady&mdash;very pretty, too&mdash;who
stopped playing ping-pong with me to listen to what
they were saying about Captain Hemming.  Of
course she didn't give that for a reason."
</p>

<p>
"What was her name?" asked Hemming.
</p>

<p>
Tarmont shook his head, and, producing his
cigarette-case, lit a mild, fat Turkish.
</p>

<p>
"I'm no good at names," he said, "but she seemed
to be about twenty-eight in age, and was beautifully
set up, a trifle on the thin side&mdash;and
had ripping fine eyes, and hair with copper in it."
</p>

<p>
Even Hemming laughed.
</p>

<p>
"You must have spent all your precious time
staring at her," remarked Potts.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I did," confessed the artist, "for I was
in love with her, man.  Even now, whenever I
draw a girl I make her waist and her arms.  As
for the look in her eyes&mdash;my dear fellow, I can
never forget it."
</p>

<p>
"What sort of a look was it?" asked Akerly,
hugely amused.
</p>

<p>
"A look of longing," replied Tarmont, in tragic
tones.  "It was deucedly disconcerting, too, for the
man she happened to be talking to.  It always made
me feel as if I had a hole in the middle of my
chest, through which she could see some chap whom
she was anxious to embrace.  We all noticed that
Anderson didn't like it at all."
</p>

<p>
Potts and Akerly roared with laughter.
</p>

<p>
"You should be a novelist," said Potts.
</p>

<p>
Akerly ordered a round-bellied, wicker-covered
flask.  But Hemming only pondered over what he
heard.
</p>

<p>
It was close upon two o'clock in the morning when
Hemming got back to the Wellington.  He found
O'Rourke snug in his bed, smiling even in his sleep.
He closed the bedroom doors softly, stirred up the
fire, and sat down to his story.  Still the wind
galloped through the square, slashing the tree-tops, and
riding against the house-fronts.
</p>

<p>
It was dawn when Hemming laid aside his pen,
knocked the smouldering heel from his pipe, and
went wearily to bed.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
A ROLLING STONE
</h3>

<p>
The life of New York did not suit Hemming,
although his work progressed at a round pace.  He
awoke in the mornings to no expectations of joy
or adventure.  The dulness of each approaching day
weighed upon him even before his eyes opened.  He
saw but little of O'Rourke after the luncheon hour,
and, though he and Tarmont became quite friendly,
loneliness made his days miserable.  He began to
regret even the foolish, anxious days of the
Pernamba revolution.  In his blue mood he would
sometimes call on the Tetsons and Hickses&mdash;but, alas,
in conventional environment they had lost much of
their charm.  Hicks was growing fat and
self-complacent.  Marion was growing commonplace under
the burden of formalities.  Even the old man was
undergoing a change&mdash;had already been weaned
from his yellow cigar and taught to wear a
four-in-hand necktie until dinner-time.  As for
Mrs. Tetson, kindly soul, why, she now spent most of
her days in contented slumber, and sometimes drove
in the park of an afternoon.
</p>

<p>
Hemming sometimes went to dinner at the Hudsons'
with O'Rourke.  Mrs. Hudson was dead, and
Helen and her father made up the family.  Hemming
found these evenings quite worth while.  Miss
Hudson was as clever as she was charming, and
as sympathetic as she was original.  Mr. Hudson
was a kind-hearted, exceedingly well-bred banker,
with a cultivated taste in wines and cigars.  Under
his daughter's leadership he sometimes talked
brilliantly.  After these dinners Hemming would always
stay as long as he could without feeling himself in
the way; then, after a word or two with Mr. Hudson
in the library, he would return to the lonely
sitting-room and write letters to Miss Travers.
These he burned as soon as written.  This was
foolishness, and worried Smith a good deal.
</p>

<p>
Tarmont, who guessed Hemming's case, got into
the habit of dropping in on his new friend at
unseemly hours.  If Hemming wanted to talk,
Tarmont was ready to listen.  If Hemming wanted to
listen, Tarmont was glad to chat about his stay in
England.  If Hemming wanted to continue his work,
Tarmont was delighted to smoke in silence,&mdash;always
those fat Eastern cigarettes,&mdash;with his heels
on any convenient piece of furniture that happened
to be higher than his head.  One night he brought
a chap named Stanley along with him.  On this
occasion his visit was timed many hours earlier than
usual&mdash;in fact, Hemming was only half-way
through his first cigarette since dinner.  Stanley
interested Hemming from the first&mdash;all the more so
because Tarmont whispered, while Stanley was
examining a shelf of books, that he would not stand
for his companion's behaviour, or anything else, as
he had met him for the first time only that morning.
</p>

<p>
Stanley looked and sounded like a man without
a care in the world, though in his black hair shone
threads of silver.  His manner was of complete
good-humour, despite the suggestion of heartless
deviltry in his dark eyes.  His complexion was of
a swarthy clearness, like a Spaniard's, and in the
cleft of his massive chin gleamed a small triangular
scar.  Something about him suggested to Hemming
a gull blown inland.  He talked of a dozen things
dear to Hemming's heart,&mdash;of salmon fishing in
Labrador, of the sea's moods, of London, of polo,
and of current literature,&mdash;treating each from the
view-point of an outsider.  The others were contented
to sit quiet and listen.  Many of his adventures
by land and sea would have been laughed at
by ordinary stay-at-homes, or even by Cook's
tourists, but Hemming's knowledge of such things
enabled him to see probabilities where Tarmont
suspected lies.  He was still spinning yarns when
O'Rourke came in.
</p>

<p>
Several days passed before Hemming again saw
Stanley&mdash;restless, painful days for Hemming, for
Stanley's stories had reawakened all that was
vagrant in his blood; the other side of his heart was
longing for England, and pride and self-ordained
duty held him in New York.  Also, the condition
of his dearest friend was getting on his nerves.  To
see the man who had so often sworn that change
and adventure were the breath of life to him eyeing
furniture with calculating glances, pricing dinner-sets,
and drawing plans of cottages on the margins
of otherwise neglected manuscripts, struck him as
verging on the idiotic.  So he prowled about the
town, and smoked more than Smith considered good
for him.  Late one night, upon leaving an up-town
studio, where a pale youth made priceless posters
and delectable coffee, he was overtaken by Stanley.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you off to?" asked Stanley.
</p>

<p>
"Home," replied Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sleepy?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Then I wish you'd let me come along.  I want
to talk."
</p>

<p>
Hemming assured him that he would be delighted
to listen, and, hailing a belated cab, they drove to
Washington Square.  O'Rourke and Smith were
both asleep.  Hemming closed their doors, and lit a
couple of candles to help the firelight make shadows
up the walls.  Then Stanley told something of his
story.  In his youth he had inherited a small
fortune.  At first he had spent it foolishly, but after
years of knocking about, had learned how to save it,
and even add to it.  The sea had been his ambition
and delight ever since his first days of freedom.
Early in his career he had qualified as a navigator.
He told of trading-schooners in Newfoundland and
Labrador, in which he was interested; of a copper-mine
somewhere that he had discovered himself, and
sold to an English syndicate; of a venture in the
sponge-fishery off the Florida coast, and of his
apprenticeship to pearl-diving.  He told of a
blunt-nosed old barque in which he owned a one-third
interest and on which he had sailed as master for
half a dozen voyages, doing a very profitable
smuggling business on the side.  He even confessed
to an irregular career as a journalist in Australia.
</p>

<p>
"I have always found my profits," he said, "and
managed to live well enough.  It is an easy world,
if you have any brains at all, but, for all that, it is
horrible.  The longer a man lives&mdash;the oftener he
saves himself from defeat&mdash;the gayer he makes his
fun&mdash;then, when he lies awake at night, the more
he has to sweat and pray about."
</p>

<p>
Hemming nodded.  "They pile up," he remarked;
then, fearing that gloomy reflections might get
the better of his guest's desire to talk, he asked
him why he had given up his berth aboard the
barque.
</p>

<p>
"Had important business to look after ashore,"
replied Stanley.  In bending over the table to light
a cigarette at a candle, he looked keenly at his
host.
</p>

<p>
"And there was another reason&mdash;a damn sight
better one," he said, quietly.
</p>

<p>
He sank back in his chair and blew a thin thread
of smoke.
</p>

<p>
"We were in Bahia with fish," he continued,
"and I got foul of one of the hands&mdash;for the last
time.  The memory of his big face makes me feel
ill to this day."
</p>

<p>
"What!" exclaimed Hemming.  "Do you mean
to tell me you let one of the crew lay you away?"
</p>

<p>
"Not quite," laughed Stanley, harshly.  He
touched the scar on his chin.  "That's what he gave
me&mdash;with a knuckle-duster," he explained, "and
what I gave him he took ashore to the hospital.  His
messmates were not particularly fond of him, but,
for all that, I considered it wise to live quietly ashore
for awhile."
</p>

<p>
"You must have handled him rather roughly,"
remarked the Englishman.
</p>

<p>
"I killed him," said Stanley.  "I beat the life
out of him with my bare fists."
</p>

<p>
"You beast," said Hemming, his face blanched
with horror and disgust.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, cheer up, old Sunday-school teacher,"
replied Stanley, good-naturedly.  "I had reason
enough for killing the slob.  He hit me first, for one
thing.  Then there was a girl in the case&mdash;a little
brown girl, who wouldn't look at a dirty brute like
him, for all that he told to the contrary.  He was
ship's bully until he got aft to the cabin."
</p>

<p>
He emptied his glass, and looked, with an
expression of bored expectancy, toward the darkest
corner of the room.
</p>

<p>
"It's about time for him now," he said, "but
maybe you don't believe in ghosts.  He favours me
with a sight of his ugly mug almost every night.
Can you see him there?"
</p>

<p>
Hemming turned with a start, but only black
shadows were in the corner.  Stanley laughed.
</p>

<p>
"What a pity," he said, "for I am sure you would
be more interested than I."
</p>

<p>
Hemming drew close to the fire, and, when his
back was turned, Stanley, with a wary eye on the
shadows, grabbed the decanter of Scotch and gulped
down a quantity of the raw liquor.  In a moment
he seemed himself again.  He set the decanter softly
back upon the table, and, with his hands in his
trousers pockets, moved over to the window and
looked out at the cold roofs, level against the dawn,
and at the lift of the silent chimneys.  His jaws
were set hard, swelling the muscles under the
swarthy skin.  He feared a hand upon his shoulder&mdash;the
heavy touch of a thick, toil-worn hand.  He
awaited, dreading, the rank breath of the dead
seaman against his ear.  Presently he turned his head,
and looked again at the shadowy corner.  It was
lighter now.  But crouched there close to the floor,
as he had crouched upon the hot deck, with red
hands knuckle down, and blood upon the ugly,
upturned face, was the bully of the barque.  The
candles burned softly, throwing their kindly radiance
upon books and pictures.  Hemming sat by the fire,
puzzled, but at peace.  Wrenching his gaze from
the hideous apparition beyond, Stanley looked
enviously at Hemming&mdash;at the clean, brave face,
whereon hardships and adventures had hardened not
a line.
</p>

<p>
Hemming fell asleep in his chair.  When he
opened his eyes, the room was full of sunlight and
his guest had gone.  He could hear O'Rourke splashing
and singing in his bath, and Smith stood at his
elbow with a cup of tea.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
"THE DEAR, DEAR WITCHERY OF SONG"
</h3>

<p>
The two friends sat late over their breakfast.
</p>

<p>
"If anything happens to me before night, will
you see that I am decently buried?" said O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see what more is to happen to
you&mdash;except bankruptcy," retorted Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I intend getting down to work again right
away," O'Rourke hastened to say.  "That is part
of my trouble," he added.  "You know that Mr. Hudson,
for all his good points, has some jolly queer
notions in his head.  He had not known me more
than a week before he asked me to let scribbling
alone and give business a chance.  I told him that
scribbling was good enough for me.  He said prose
was bad, but to see a bushy chap, six feet high,
writing poetry, simply made him sick.  I was mad,
but&mdash;well, I was also afraid.  I know him better
now.  He made me promise not to mention the
conversation to Helen, and tried to fire my soul with
the desire for banking.  He even offered me a job.
Well, to oblige him I determined to try to give up
writing, and I've been struggling along now for
nearly three weeks.  Gad, I'm sick of it.  Helen
does not know, of course, what the matter is, and
thinks I'm out of condition, or that her company
is not inspiring; and all the time the finest things
are swinging about in my head, and my fingers are
itching for a good corky penholder.  Last night I
realized that both my money and peace of mind
were leaving me, so I turned out early this morning
and wrote seven verses to Helen, and sketched out
two stories, and an article on the Jamaica fruit
trade, and now I'm going to tell old Hudson that
he can go&mdash;I mean that I will not consider his
proposition a moment longer."
</p>

<p>
"And what about the lady?" asked Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Who&mdash;Helen?  Oh, she'll make it warm for
her father when she hears about it, I can tell you,"
answered O'Rourke.
</p>

<p>
While Hemming interviewed Smith on household
topics, O'Rourke scribbled a quatrain on his cuff, and
then invented conversation between himself and
Mr. Hudson.  This form of amusement is exciting&mdash;better
even than writing dialogue.  One cannot help
figuring as the hero.  The best time for it is when
you are walking alone, late at night, perhaps in a
rainstorm.  The ideas swing along with your stride,
and the words patter with the rain.  But O'Rourke,
in his mood, found nine o'clock in the morning good
enough, and, by the time Hemming was ready to
go out, had made sixteen different wrecks of poor
Hudson's ideas on the subject of authorship as a
profession.  His courage returned to its normal
elevation, and as they walked along he entertained
Hemming with his brave dreams of the future.
</p>

<p>
The friends parted company at the door of
Hemming's publishers; O'Rourke took a car for an
up-town resident quarter.  He might have seen
Mr. Hudson at his office, which was on Broadway, but
he wanted to see Helen first, and assure himself of
her support.
</p>

<p>
Helen was pleased, though surprised, at seeing
him so early.  She received him in the morning-room,
which was delightfully informal.  He asked
her to ride with him at four o'clock, and spoke as if
this was his reason for calling.  But she thought
not.  Presently she caught sight of the neat lettering
on the otherwise spotless cuff, and without so
much as "by your leave" took hold of his wrist,
pushed back his coat-sleeve, and read the quatrain.
</p>

<p>
"My dear boy," she said, "it is fine.  And I was
just beginning to fear that this old town had made
you stupid, or&mdash;or that my companionship makes
you dull.  I wondered if, after all, I was not inspiring."
</p>

<p>
"You not inspiring!" exclaimed O'Rourke.
"Why, I have had to smother more inspirations
during the last few weeks than I ever had before in
all my life.  There's more inspiration in one of your
eyelashes than in all the hair on all the heads of
all the other people in the world."
</p>

<p>
"Silly," she said.
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke did not retort in words.
</p>

<p>
"But why did you smother the inspirations, you
boy?" she asked, presently.
</p>

<p>
"I can't tell you now," he replied.  "But at four
o'clock I'll confess all.  You want the red mare, I
suppose.  I'm off now to see your pater.  Wish
me luck, little girl."
</p>

<p>
Helen smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you don't let all your cats out of their
bags as easily as that," she said.  "But it will save
you the trouble of making confession later.  Yes,
the red mare, please.  And, dear boy, I'll have a
little talk with father at lunch, and he will never
make you smother your dear inspirations again.
There, that will do.  Now run away and beard the
lion.  Really, you behave as if you were afraid of
never finding me again."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I've made sure of you this time," he said.
Then he remembered the seven verses, and, pulling
them from his pocket, read them aloud.  The fire
in the morning-room was wonderfully cheerful.  The
clock clicked softly, and chimed once or twice,
unheeded.  They talked a great deal, and made plans
for the future, and O'Rourke smoked a cigarette.
When Mr. Hudson came home to his lunch, he found
them still engaged in conversation beside the
morning-room fire.  They looked guiltily at the clock.
O'Rourke bowed to Mr. Hudson, and extended his
hand.
</p>

<p>
"I have decided, sir, to stick to scribbling," said
he.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-277"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-277.jpg" alt="&quot;'I HAVE DECIDED, SIR, TO STICK TO SCRIBBLING'&quot;">
<br>
&quot;'I HAVE DECIDED, SIR, TO STICK TO SCRIBBLING'&quot;
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever think of not sticking to it?" she
asked.  O'Rourke gazed straight ahead, and had
the grace to blush.  A truthful woman can
always&mdash;well, act&mdash;with more ease than a truthful
man.
</p>

<p>
"I am not fit for anything else," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Dear me, dear me," said Hudson, glancing
nervously at his daughter.  "I haven't a doubt that
you are right, Bertram.  A man should be the best
judge himself of what he is good for."
</p>

<p>
"And now," said the lady, "you may stay to
lunch.  But you must hurry away right afterward
for the horses."
</p>

<p>
So O'Rourke remained to lunch, and was vastly
entertaining, and Mr. Hudson thawed again, having
decided, during the soup, to accept the inevitable.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
AN UNCANNY GUEST
</h3>

<p>
Hemming finished his novel and took it to his
publisher.  Then he decided to go somewhere,&mdash;to
get out of New York and back to the life that
meant something.  He confided his intention to
O'Rourke, and later to Smith.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you'd wait for awhile," pleaded
O'Rourke, "and then I'd go with you."
</p>

<p>
"How long do you want me to wait?" asked
Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, until we're married."
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott, man, surely you don't intend
deserting your bride immediately after the marriage
ceremony!"
</p>

<p>
"Not much," exclaimed O'Rourke, "but she
could come, too."
</p>

<p>
Hemming stared, for he knew that many of his
friend's jokes required a lot of looking at; and
Smith, who was tidying the table, hid his smile
in the duster.
</p>

<p>
"What have you been drinking?" inquired Hemming
at last.  O'Rourke made a movement as one
awaking from a trance.  He smiled foolishly.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me," he said; "for a moment I quite
forgot what sort of trips we used to indulge in.
Of course it would never do to take Helen on jaunts
like those."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if you are old enough to take care
of a wife," said his friend, severely.
</p>

<p>
When Hemming returned to his rooms late that
evening, he was still undecided as to where he would
go.  O'Rourke was away at some sort of function.
Hemming had been walking for more than an hour,
aimlessly, but at a hard pace.  As he dropped
wearily into his chair, Smith entered, and handed
him a paper from the table.  It was a note from
Stanley, written in red ink on the back of a
laundry list.  It ran as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Hurry 'round to my diggings as soon as you
get this.  I want you to meet my seafaring friend,
who seems in a mood to honour me with a visit of
some length.  He is very droll, and looks as if
he means to stay.  I send this by our hall boy.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Merrily yours,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"T. F. STANLEY."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He found Stanley alone in a big and lavishly
furnished room.  He sat at a table, whereon stood two
glasses, a syphon of soda-water, and a decanter.
He stood up upon Hemming's entrance.  "Ah,"
he said, "this is good of you.  We had almost
given up hopes of seeing you to-night."
</p>

<p>
"I was out," replied Hemming, "and just got
your note.  Where is your seafaring friend?"
</p>

<p>
"Allow me to introduce you," said Stanley.
"Mr. Kelley, my friend, Mr. Hemming."
</p>

<p>
Hemming looked about him, open-mouthed, and,
though he straightened his monocle, he could see
neither hair nor track of Mr. Kelley.
</p>

<p>
"What is your game?" he inquired, icily.
</p>

<p>
"It is as I feared," said Stanley, "and I assure
you the loss is yours.  I alone may enjoy Kelley's
delightful society, it appears.  His very smile, as he
sits there, has a world of humour in it.  He tells
such droll stories, too, of his adventures by land
and sea."
</p>

<p>
Hemming caught him roughly by the arm.
"What damned nonsense is this?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Stanley pulled himself away, and the Englishman,
fearless though he was, felt daunted by the
strange light in his host's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't like my friend, why, get out!"
cried Stanley.  "If you're a snob, and won't drink
with a common sailor, and a dead one at that, why,
just say so.  But I tell you, Hemming, I like him.
I didn't when I killed him, but I love him now.
You should hear him sing."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Hemming stood undecided.  Then
he removed his overcoat, and drew a chair for
himself up to the table.
</p>

<p>
"I am very stupid to-night," he said, smiling.
"Of course I'll have a drink with you and Kelley.
Just a couple of fingers, old chap.  Kelley seems
a good sort.  Do you think he will favour us with
a song?"
</p>

<p>
Stanley got another glass, and poured the whiskey
for his guest.  His face was haggard, though
he was clearly pleased with Hemming's change of
manner.  "Oh, he is a good sort, sure enough,"
he said, "but I don't believe you could hear him
sing.  It is all I can do sometimes.  He has a fine
voice, but he is a bit handicapped by the cut in his
lip.  Do you notice the cut in his lip?  I gave him
that years ago.  Knocked four or five teeth down
his neck, too, I guess.  Do you know, Hemming,
I was afraid, when you first came in, that you
thought me nutty."
</p>

<p>
For a little while Stanley seemed sunk too deep
in meditation for utterance.  He looked up
presently, but not at Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Kelley," he said, "<i>you</i> can understand being
afraid of a man, and there was a time when <i>I</i> was
afraid of a ghost, but what do you think of a man
who is afraid of a woman?"  He paused for a
moment, and seemed to receive an answer, for he
laughed and continued, "Just my sentiment, old
cock.  She isn't after him with a knife, either.
She is in love with him, and once he was in love
with her, but now he's afraid to go within miles
of her.  He's in love with her, too; at least, so
they told Tarmont."
</p>

<p>
Hemming jumped from his chair.  "Who the
devil are you talking about?" he cried.
</p>

<p>
Stanley glared blankly for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Why, sure enough; I'm talking about you,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"See here, Stanley," exclaimed the Englishman,
earnestly, "are you drunk, or are you mad, or are
you only making a fool of yourself, and trying
to make one of me?"
</p>

<p>
"I am not drunk," replied the other, slowly,
"and why should I try to make a fool of you?
Some one has saved me that trouble.  But I may
be mad, old chap, though I haven't taken to biting
people yet."
</p>

<p>
Hemming started, and glanced about him uneasily.
"Well, I really must go," he said; "I
have some work to do," and he hurried away
without shaking hands.  He went to the nearest
drug-store, where he might use the public telephone.
He was about to ring up a doctor when an amused
chuckle at his shoulder arrested him.  He turned
his head.  There stood Stanley, leering pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't trouble yourself.  I'm not wanting medical
advice just now," said Stanley.  In his confusion,
Hemming blushed guiltily, and left the telephone,
and the shop, without a word.  As he passed
into the street, he heard Stanley laughing with the
cashier, very likely explaining his action as that
of a harmless idiot.
</p>

<p>
Hemming made all speed to Washington Square.
O'Rourke had not yet returned, but on a scrap of
paper among his manuscripts he found Tarmont's
address.  With the help of a cab, he was soon in
that gentleman's studio.  But, to his disgust, he
found that he was not the only visitor.  Half a
dozen men were lounging on the wide divans,
smoking.  Hemming managed to get Tarmont away
from the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen Stanley to-day?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not since last night.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"He is mad as a hatter.  Thinks he is entertaining
some dead sailor in his rooms."
</p>

<p>
"Heavens!" exclaimed the artist.
</p>

<p>
"He talked rather wildly about several things,"
said Hemming, "and quoted you concerning a girl
in England&mdash;and me."
</p>

<p>
"He may have heard me speaking of it," returned
Tarmont, defiantly.  "He was here last
night."
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you tell me?" asked the Englishman.
</p>

<p>
"It was just country-house gossip," replied the
artist, "and I hardly thought you would thank
me.  I imagined you were old enough to know your
own business best."
</p>

<p>
"It was country-house gossip, and now you have
made studio gossip of it," said Hemming, tartly.
</p>

<p>
"I am very sorry," said Tarmont, honestly.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
THE BACHELOR UNCLE TO THE RESCUE
</h3>

<p>
The years since Hemming's departure had
brought little of joy to Molly Travers.  At first
anger at herself had occupied her mind.  Then had
come a short-lived anger toward Hemming for not
writing or returning.  Now she looked at life with
a calm heartlessness.  When she learned the true
story of Penthouse a white fury entered into her,
and she knew that there was not a person in the
world whom she would now trust,&mdash;save Hemming,
the man who despised her.  Her mother tried
to comfort her; tried to reason with her; tried to
soothe her with platitudes and eligible suitors.  For
her pains, the poor woman was snubbed.  So were
the suitors&mdash;at first.  But, as the seasons wore
around, with no word of love or forgiveness from
the man whose love she had tramped on, Miss Travers
decided to take her revenge on the world.  She
took it daintily, and the world hardly knew what
she was about.  First, and always, there was Anderson.
At first, love for the girl, and loyalty for his
friend, struggled hard within him.  Love won
against loyalty.  Then he found that she did not
care.  He was of a hopeful disposition, and continued
to make a fool of himself even to the last, as
you shall see.  There were others,&mdash;a subaltern,
a lawyer, the son of a colonial premier, and a
baronet.  It was always so cleverly done that not one
of them could lay the blame on her.  Tarmont, the
young artist, was the first to understand.  He saved
himself just in time.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Travers was in despair, especially when the
baronet rode away.  At last it occurred to her that
still the memory of Hemming, the adventurer, stood
between her daughter and a comfortable settlement
in life.  Why any one should prefer the memory
of a poor man to the reality of a rich one, she really
could not see.  She was afraid to ask Molly for a
solution of the problem (having learned something
by experience), so she wrote a note to her brother.
Mr. Pollin came promptly, and gave ear to the
narration of her troubles with polite concern.  When
she had made a piteous end of it, he told her that
she was fretting herself quite unnecessarily.
</p>

<p>
"I'll speak to Molly," he said, in a reassuring
voice.
</p>

<p>
"But she does not like being spoken to,"
complained Mrs. Travers.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she is really a sensible girl, and I am not
afraid of her," said Mr. Pollin.
</p>

<p>
"Had I better call her now?" suggested the lady.
</p>

<p>
"Lord, no!" cried her brother.  "I'll see her
alone,&mdash;some other day."
</p>

<p>
One morning, Molly received a visit from her
bachelor uncle, much to her surprise.  What little
she knew of her uncle rather attracted her.  More
than once she had detected signs of thought, even
of intellect, in his conversation.  Also, she had
heard something of his early career and of the
articles he had written.  She greeted him brightly.
He held her hand, and glanced around the depressing
drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, this is no place to talk," he said.
</p>

<p>
"No, not to really talk," she agreed, "but it
is not often used for that."  Then she looked at
him suspiciously.  "Are you going to scold me
about something, uncle?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
He laughed, and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no.  I am not as courageous as I look," he
replied.
</p>

<p>
She wondered if this round, trim, elderly gentleman
really imagined that he looked so.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know where else we can go," she said.
"Mother is in the morning-room, and the library
is being cleaned."
</p>

<p>
"If you will come for a walk," he said, with
a winning hesitancy in his manner.
</p>

<p>
Molly smiled.  "I'll come," she answered,
"though I am quite sure you have something very
disagreeable to say, otherwise why all this trouble?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear girl," began Mr. Pollin, "I do not
wonder at your suspicion.  Really, though, it is
without grounds.  I simply want to become better
acquainted with an interesting and charming niece
whom I have hitherto somewhat neglected."
</p>

<p>
"Then it is a matter of duty," laughed Molly.
</p>

<p>
"On your part, my dear," replied her uncle, with
a gallant bow.
</p>

<p>
"Then wait a moment," she said, and left the
room.
</p>

<p>
The moment lengthened into twenty minutes, at
the end of which time Miss Travers reappeared,
gowned for the street.
</p>

<p>
"By gad, I don't blame the young fools!"
muttered Mr. Pollin to himself, as he followed her
down the steps.  At first their conversation was
of trivialities.  It soon worked around to books,
and Molly found, to her delight and surprise, that
her uncle had not altogether forsaken his first love,
to wit,&mdash;literature.
</p>

<p>
"I have cloaked myself with the reputation of
a gossip," he told her, "to hide my greater sins
of serious reading and amateur scribbling.  A
literary man must be successful from the most worldly
point of view, to be considered with any leniency
by his friends.  So I keep dark, and enjoy myself
and the respect of&mdash;of the people we know.  When
I was younger, I was not so wise."
</p>

<p>
"I have heard about it," returned Molly, "and
I always liked you for it.  But I think you were
a coward to give it up just as soon as you came
in for money."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pollin smiled somewhat sadly.
</p>

<p>
"I was never anything more than a dabbler.
That is my only excuse for shunning the muse in
public," he replied.  "But here we are at the door
of my humble habitation."
</p>

<p>
"I have seen the door before.  It looks very
nice," remarked Molly.
</p>

<p>
"On the other side of that door," said Mr. Pollin,
standing still and surveying the oak, "are
two hundred and odd rare volumes, and three times
as many more or less common ones,&mdash;also some
easy chairs, and a man-servant capable of producing
a modest luncheon."
</p>

<p>
"And cigarettes?" asked Miss Travers.
</p>

<p>
The gentleman gave her a look of pained inquiry.
</p>

<p>
"For you, my dear girl?" he queried.
</p>

<p>
"I have not smoked a cigarette for years," she
replied, "but I learned how&mdash;oh, long ago."
</p>

<p>
"I have some excellent cigarettes," rejoined Mr. Pollin,
kindly, as he fitted his latch-key in the door.
</p>

<p>
Molly found that, for a poor bachelor, her uncle
lived very comfortably.  She really did not see
how one man and his valet could use so many rooms.
The library was a charming place, walled with
shelves of books, and warmed and brightened by
a glowing fire.  The floor had no carpet, but was
thickly strewn with rugs.  The chairs were of
modern pattern and wicker ware, built for comfort
rather than for looks.  The big writing-table had
books, magazines, and manuscripts scattered over
it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pollin rang for his man, who appeared on
the instant.
</p>

<p>
"My niece, Miss Travers, will lunch with me,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"Very good, sir," replied the man, and hesitated
at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Scanlan?" inquired his master.
</p>

<p>
"General Davidson, sir,&mdash;and the lady, sir,&mdash;will
that be hall?"
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!" exclaimed Mr. Pollin, "I'd forgotten
the general.  You don't mind old Davidson,
do you, Molly?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I do not know.  I have never met
him," replied Molly.
</p>

<p>
"That will be all," said Mr. Pollin to the man,
and, as soon as the door closed, he turned to Molly
and said: "Now, my dear, we have just an hour
before that old bore Davidson, with his everlasting
plans of battles, gets here, so we had better make the
most of our time."  He stirred the fire, and then
seated himself close to his niece.  He looked at her
nervously, and several times opened his mouth as
if to speak, but always seemed to think better of
it before he had made a sound.
</p>

<p>
"Why, what on earth is the matter?" cried Miss
Travers, staring with wide eyes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pollin braced himself, and swallowed hard.
"My dear," he said, "I want to confess that I
promised your mother that I would speak to you
about&mdash;about&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"About what, uncle?"  She breathed fast, and
her face was anxious.
</p>

<p>
"Dash it all, about some silly rot!" cried the
old gentleman, "and, by gad, I don't intend to
mention it.  You are quite old enough to look after
your own affairs,&mdash;of that nature,&mdash;and you are
much wiser than the people who wish to look after
them for you."
</p>

<p>
"I know what it is," said Molly, slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Then don't give it another thought," said Mr. Pollin.
He patted her hand gently, and sighed with
relief.  "Now we can have a cigarette," he said.
But his real task was yet to come.  He wanted to
know, by her own showing, if she still cared for
Hemming.  How the devil was it to be done, he
wondered.  He looked at the clock, and saw that
the general was not due inside another forty minutes.
He looked at Molly.  She leaned back in his deepest
chair, looking blissfully at home and uncommonly
pretty.  Her slight, rounded figure was turned
sidewise between the padded arms of the chair,
while her grave gaze explored the book-shelves.
Between two fingers of her right hand she held
a fat cigarette, unlighted.
</p>

<p>
"What a lucky man an uncle is," he murmured.
</p>

<p>
She wrinkled her eyes at him for a moment, and
then laughed softly.  "That was very prettily said;
but I would much rather you read to me&mdash;something
that you are very fond of.  I'll see if I like
it.  Perhaps our tastes are a good deal the same,
and, if so, you will be able to save me a lot of time
and temper by telling me what to read."
</p>

<p>
"A literary adviser," suggested Mr. Pollin, as
he fumbled through a stack of magazines and papers
beside his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Surely you will not find anything in the
magazines," she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
In answer, he selected one from the heap, and
opened it at a marked page.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"'Pedro, the Fisherman,' is the name of it,"
he replied, and straightway began to read.
</p>

<p>
It was a simple story of a small, brown boy
somewhere at the other side of the world, and yet the
beauty, the humble joy, and the humble pathos,
made of it a masterpiece,&mdash;for the seeing ones.
Pollin read it well, with sympathy in his voice and
manner, but with no extravagance of expression.
When he came to the end (it was a very short
story), he got up hurriedly and placed the
magazine in his niece's lap.
</p>

<p>
"I must see how Scanlan is getting along," he
said, and left the room.
</p>

<p>
Molly sat very still, with the magazine face down
upon her knee.  Her eyes, abrim with tears, saw
nothing of the glowing fire toward which they were
turned.  There was no need for her to look, to see
by whom the story was written.  Who but her old
lover could touch her so with the silent magic of
printed words?  She forgot, for awhile, the
unanswered letter and the weary seasons through which
she had vainly waited for his forgiveness.  Now
she saw only the exile,&mdash;the wanderer,&mdash;and her
heart bled for him.  He would be wiser than of
old, she thought, but still gentle and still fearless.
A cynic?&mdash;no, he could never be that.  Such a
heart, though embittered against one woman, would
not turn against the whole of God's world.  She
had thrown aside the love that now read and translated
the sufferings and joys of outland camps and
cities.  The very tenderness that enabled him to
understand the men and women of which he wrote
had once been all for her.
</p>

<p>
The magazine slid to the floor, and a loose page,
evidently cut from some other periodical, fluttered
to one side.  Molly sat up and recovered it.
Listlessly she turned it over.  Here were verses by
Hemming.  Her tears blotted the lines as she read:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="poem">
  "When the palms are black, and the stars are low, and even<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the trade-winds sleep,<br>
  God, give my longing wings, to span the valleys and hills<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the deep!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And again,&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="poem">
  "The sailor's voyage is a thousand miles, 'bout ship, and a<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand more!<br>
  By landfall, pilot, and weed-hung wharf,&mdash;to the lass at the<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cabin door.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But mine!&mdash;fool heart, what a voyage is this, storm-beaten<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on every sea,<br>
  With never the glow of an open door and a lamp on the sill<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for me?"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When Mr. Pollin returned to the library, he
found his niece with her face hidden in the
cushions of the chair, weeping quietly.  He had
half-expected something unusual, but the sight of her
grief made him feel like a fool.  He picked up
the magazine, and replaced it neatly on the top of
the pile.  Then he noticed the clipping containing
Hemming's verses, damp and crumpled, at her feet.
That's what did it, he thought, and was about to
recover it, too, when his attention was diverted by
the sound of wheels at his curb.
</p>

<p>
"The general," he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
Molly sat up quickly, and mopped her eyes.  "I
think I must have fallen asleep," she said, with her
face turned away from her uncle.  But he was the
more confused of the two.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my dear," he said, "but now you must
dry your&mdash;I mean, wake up, for the general is
at the door."  He went to the window.  With the
tail of his eye, he saw Molly stoop, quick as a flash,
pluck something from the rug at her feet, and thrust
it into the front of her dress.  Next moment the
general was announced.
</p>

<p>
The lunch was sent in from the kitchen of a
famous restaurant, and was artfully served by Scanlan.
During the first part of the meal, the general
did little but eat.  He had a surprisingly healthy
appetite for a retired British soldier of his age and
rank.  Later he talked, beginning with his little
say concerning the War Office.  That institution
suffered severely.
</p>

<p>
"Bless my soul! what did they need of a commission
to look into the state of affairs?" he fumed.
"I could have told them about the rifles years ago.
Why, man, I lugged one of the useless things to
Newfoundland with me, and first day on the barrens
crawled to within sixty yards of a stag, and
sniped at him steady as a church,&mdash;with my elbow
on a rock, mind you.  Off walked the stag, so I
popped again.  At that, he walked a bit farther,
and shook his head.  My half-breed sniggered.
'Damn you,' I said (there were no ladies there,
Miss Travers; I never swear before women and
parson's), 'make me a target, and I'll see what's
the matter with this blessed shootin'-iron.'  Sacobie
fixed up a target, and we both blazed at it&mdash;turn
about&mdash;all afternoon.  Every bullet went eighteen
feet to the left.  Gad, if they had only heard me
that day, they would have guessed that something
was wrong with the sightin' of their precious rifles."
</p>

<p>
Next, he held forth on military matters in
general, even down to rations and uniforms for men
in the field.  "The matter with our Tommies," he
declared, "is that the poor beggars haven't wind
enough to march with, tied about as they are with
a lot of idiotic straps."
</p>

<p>
Presently, much to Molly's surprise, he pushed
his wine-glasses to one side, and asked for a copy
of "Where Might Is Right."
</p>

<p>
"This chap, Hemming, considering his lack of
age, knows a wonderful lot about it," he said, when
he got the book in his hand.  He fluttered the pages,
and soon found a passage that seemed to please him.
He straightway read it aloud, in ringing tones and
with a grand air.
</p>

<p>
"I call that inevitable&mdash;inevitable," he cried,
glaring the while at his host and the lady, as if
looking for contradictions.
</p>

<p>
"It strikes me as remarkably true," agreed
Mr. Pollin.  Molly said nothing, but something of the
inner glow of pride must have shone in her face,
for her uncle glanced at her, and smiled knowingly.
</p>

<p>
The general left shortly after lunch, for he was
a man of affairs,&mdash;mostly other people's.
</p>

<p>
"I must go now," said Molly.  "Mother will
be wondering what you have done with me."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pollin took both her hands between his, and
pressed them warmly.
</p>

<p>
"Do you love Bert Hemming?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
She turned her face away, and did not answer.
But he felt her hands tremble in his, and saw the
red glow on neck and cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Bring him back," he said.  "If you love him,
why ruin your own life as well as his?"
</p>

<p>
"I wrote to him&mdash;long ago&mdash;and he&mdash;he
took no notice," whispered Molly.
</p>

<p>
"And you never wrote again?" inquired her
uncle.
</p>

<p>
"Why should I?  He despises me,&mdash;or he
would have answered that letter.  I&mdash;I dragged
my heart before him," she sobbed.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pollin let go her hands, and slipped one arm
around her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"My dear little girl," he replied, "letters have
been known to go astray,&mdash;just as conclusions
have."  He patted her bowed head with his free
hand.  "Why, once I lost a letter with a money
order in it," he added, seriously.
</p>

<p>
Molly brushed away her tears.  "I must go now,"
she said, moving away from him.  She put up her
hands to straighten her hair.  Then a sudden
thought occurred to her, and she plucked
Mr. Pollin's sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle, we must both forget about to-day," she
said.
</p>

<p>
"Not I," he replied.  "I am going to write&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He stopped short, spellbound by her sudden
change of countenance and manner.  Her eyes
fairly flamed.  Her whole body trembled.
</p>

<p>
"You would not dare!" she cried.  "Oh, you
would not dare!  Are you, too, nothing but a
busybody?"
</p>

<p>
Poor old Pollin gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!  I meant it for the best," he
exclaimed, weakly, "but just as you say, my dear."
</p>

<p>
He took her home, and, by the time her door
was reached, her manner toward him had again
warmed.
</p>

<p>
"It was a charming lunch," she said, as they
shook hands.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pollin sat at his writing-table, and dipped
his pen in the ink, only to dot lines on his blotter.
</p>

<p>
"The girl was right," he said, "I don't dare."
</p>

<p>
He lit a cigarette, and for several minutes
contemplated wreaths of smoke, without moving.
Suddenly he leaned forward, took a fresh dip of ink,
and scribbled:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"DEAR BERT:&mdash;You are a fool to stay away,&mdash;unless,
perhaps, you no longer care for the girl."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Without adding his signature to this offhand
communication, he enclosed it in an envelope, and
addressed the same to Hemming, care of his New
York publishers.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
</h3>

<h3>
HEMMING RECEIVES HIS SAILING ORDERS FROM A
<br>
MASTER NOT TO BE DENIED
</h3>

<p>
Stanley was taken to a private lunatic asylum,
and, for all we know to the contrary, his seafaring
friend went along with him.  Hemming and Tarmont
looked through his papers, and found that
his father was living (and living well, too) in
Toronto, Canada.  He was a judge of the Supreme
Court, no less.  They wrote to this personage,
stating the crazy man's case, and in reply received a
letter containing a request to enter the patient at
a private asylum, and a substantial check.  The
judge wrote that he had not seen or heard from his
son for seven years, and, though he had always
been willing to supply him with money, had been
unable to discover his address.  He arrived in New
York soon after his letter,&mdash;a big, kindly man with
white hair and red cheeks, and a month later took
his son home with him.  That was the last
Hemming saw or heard of Stanley,&mdash;of the man to
whom he owed more than he had knowledge of.
</p>

<p>
O'Rourke's affairs went along merrily.  He wrote
and sold stories and poems.  His name began to
appear each month on the cover of a certain widely
read magazine.  Everything was in line for an
early wedding and a career of happiness "for ever
after."
</p>

<p>
One morning, while O'Rourke was hard at work,
Hemming, who had gone out immediately after
breakfast, returned to their sitting-room and laid
a red leather case on his friend's manuscript.
O'Rourke completed a flowing sentence, and then
straightened up and opened the case.  A very fine
brier-root pipe was disclosed to his view.
</p>

<p>
"Where did you steal this?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"It is a present for you," said Hemming, dropping
into a chair.  O'Rourke put down his pen,
and eyed his friend with an air of surprise.
</p>

<p>
"A present!" he exclaimed.  "Why, my dear
chap, surely I've been taking anything of yours
that I happened to want long enough for you to see
that there is no need of this depressing formality."
</p>

<p>
"But we've been such chums."
</p>

<p>
"You haven't just found that out, I hope."
</p>

<p>
Hemming shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going away," he explained, "and I
suppose it will be without you this time."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't mind going to Staten Island,"
replied O'Rourke, "but for any farther than that
you will have to mark me out."
</p>

<p>
"I sail for England to-morrow," Hemming informed him.
</p>

<p>
"Have you been&mdash;have you received a letter,
or anything of that kind?" inquired his comrade.
</p>

<p>
"No, but Stanley told me I was a fool not to
go back."
</p>

<p>
"Could have told you that myself."
</p>

<p>
"Then why didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Thought you knew it."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know it,&mdash;and I am not sure, even
now," retorted Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Well, old man," rejoined O'Rourke, "you know
her better than I do, so suit yourself.  But my
advice is the same as Stanley's."
</p>

<p>
He stared moodily at the Englishman.  In fact,
he was already lonely for his energetic, steel-true
roommate.  What days and nights they had seen
together!  What adventures they had sped, knee
to knee!  What vigils they had kept by the
camp-fires and under the cabin-lamps!  And now a
girl!&mdash;but at that thought his brow cleared.
</p>

<p>
"I think we have both done with the old pace,"
he remarked, pensively.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder," said Hemming.
</p>

<p>
That night about a dozen men gathered in
Tarmont's studio.  Hemming was the guest of
honour.  The big room was soon filled with smoke.
There were many things to drink and a few things
to eat.  Songs were sung, and stories told.
Hemming tried to make a speech, and O'Rourke had
to finish it for him.  After that, Tarmont suggested
leap-frog.
</p>

<p>
"Just wait until I do my little stunt," begged
Potts.  He tuned his banjo, and, to an accompaniment
of his own composing, sang the following
verses:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="poem">
  "'You may light your lamps to cheer me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may tune your harps for me,<br>
  But my heart is with my shipmates<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the lights are on the sea.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'You may wine me, you may dine me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may pledge me to the brim,<br>
  But my heart is pledging Charlie,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you have no thought of him.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'You may cheer me with your friendship,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you are gentlemen,<br>
  But the friend I want the hand-grip of<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not within your ken.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'So keep your praise, and keep your blame,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And save your good red wine,<br>
  For though this town be home for you,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no home of mine.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'And when your lights are brightest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, then, across the glare,<br>
  I pledge my friends of yesterday,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love of otherwhere.'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The applause was loud and long.  They patted
the singer on the back, and thumped him on the
chest.  They gave him three cheers and a drink
(which made more than three drinks).  O'Rourke
shouted for their attention.
</p>

<p>
"All Potts did was make up the silly tune," he
cried.  "I wrote the verses&mdash;with my little pen."
</p>

<p>
When Hemming and O'Rourke got back to their
rooms, they found a steamer-trunk and a couple
of bags packed and strapped, and Smith snug abed.
The time was 2.30 A.M.  They lit the fire, changed
their coats, and drew their chairs to the hearth.
O'Rourke placed a decanter and glasses on the
corner of the table.  They talked a little in
murmured, disjointed sentences.  Each followed his
own thoughts as they harked back to the past and
worked into the future.  They sipped their Scotch
and soda, with meditative eyes on the fire.
O'Rourke sighed.  "Thank God, Helen likes New
York no better than I do," he said.
</p>

<p>
Hemming looked up and nodded.
</p>

<p>
"My boy," he said, gravely, "if I ever find you
and Helen blinking out such a stupid existence as
the thing some of our friends call life, I'll drop you
both."
</p>

<p>
"No danger of that," laughed O'Rourke, happily.
</p>

<p>
"Remember the Hickses," warned Hemming.
</p>

<p>
For long after O'Rourke had turned in, Hemming
continued his musings by the sinking fire.
Just as the dawn gleamed blue between the curtains,
he lit a candle, and unrolled the final proof-sheets
of his novel.  By the time these were corrected to
his satisfaction, the room was flooded with
sunshine, and Smith was astir.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0308"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
HEMMING WOULD PUT HIS DREAMS TO THE PROOF
</h3>

<p>
On arriving in London, Hemming went straight
to the Portland Hotel.  As soon as Smith had
unpacked enough of his things to allow him to
dress, he chartered a cab and hastened toward his
old haunts.  It was close upon seven o'clock; the
night falling black with an upper fog, and the
streets alive with the red and white lights on either
hand, and the golden eyes of the hansoms.  At his
old club in Piccadilly he loitered for awhile on the
lookout for familiar faces, and wondering where
he could find Anderson.  His courage, which had
often failed altogether during the voyage&mdash;especially
in the early mornings&mdash;was now at its
height.  In this brave mood he felt quite sure that
all those lonely years had been nothing but a
frightful, foolish mistake.  He wanted to talk it over
with Anderson.  His old friend would give him
some tips as to how the land lay, and what obstacles
to look out for.  From a waiter, he learned that
Major Anderson was then in town, and frequented
this club, so, leaving a note for him, he went on
foot to Piccadilly Circus.  At the Trocadero, he
found a quiet table, and ordered a quiet dinner.
As he waited, he watched the people in the place
with happy interest.  They came, as he had so
often seen them come there before, these men and
women in evening dress, laughing and whispering,
but now talking of a hundred things to which he
was a stranger.  The waiters slid about grave and
attentive as of old.  The women pulled at their
gloves, and glanced about them, and more than
once Hemming bore, undisturbed, the scrutiny of
fair and questioning eyes.  But throughout the dinner,
he had some difficulty in curbing his impatience.
He was keen to put this dream of his to the test;
and yet, with the thought of going to her and
looking into her eyes for what his heart so valiantly
promised him, came always the memory of that last
parting.  Her injustice had burned deep, but still
more painful was the recollection of her brief show
of relenting,&mdash;for then he had turned away.
</p>

<p>
Still in a brown study, he sipped his coffee and
inhaled his cigarette.  Visions from the days of his
old happiness came to him, and his hand trembled
as it never had in anger or fatigue.  He built dreams
of the wonderful meeting.  Would her eyes lighten
as Helen Hudson's had when O'Rourke returned
from his exile?
</p>

<p>
Some one touched his elbow.  He started up,
and beheld Anderson.
</p>

<p>
Though the major said the usual things, and
shook hands with extreme cordiality, Hemming
noticed a tinge of reserve in the greeting.
</p>

<p>
"This <i>is</i> a surprise," stammered Anderson,
examining the tip of his cigar with an exhibition of
interest that seemed to the other quite uncalled for.
</p>

<p>
"You don't think it is loaded, do you?" inquired
Hemming, smiling patiently.
</p>

<p>
"Loaded!" exclaimed the major, with a start;
"oh,&mdash;the cigar.  Ha, ha."
</p>

<p>
Hemming's smile became strangely fixed, as he
surveyed his friend across the little table.  Could
this be the same old Anderson, he mused; and, if
so, why so confoundedly chesty?  Could it be that a
staff appointment had come his way?  He gave
up the riddle, and related some of his adventures
in Pernamba, and told of the end of Penthouse's
misguided career.
</p>

<p>
"I saw something about the revolution and
your heroism in the New York papers," said
Anderson, "but there was no mention of Penthouse."
</p>

<p>
"He called himself Cuddlehead at that time,&mdash;and
really it was hardly worth while enlightening
the press on that point," replied Hemming.  "He
was related to Mrs. Travers," he added.
</p>

<p>
The major moved uneasily in his chair.
</p>

<p>
"By the way," continued Hemming, with a poor
attempt at a casual air, "how are Mrs. Travers and
Molly?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe they are very well," replied his friend.
</p>

<p>
"See here, Dick," cried the man of adventures,
with a vast change of manner, "I must show my
hand.  Why should I try to bluff you, anyway?
Tell me, old chap, do you think I have half a
chance."
</p>

<p>
The colour faded from the major's ruddy cheeks,
and he looked forlorn and pathetic, despite his
swagger and size.
</p>

<p>
"Half a chance," he repeated, vaguely,&mdash;"half
a chance at what?"
</p>

<p>
"You used to know well enough," cried the
other.  "Damn it, are my affairs so soon forgotten?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought you had forgotten them yourself.
It is a long time since you went away, you know,"
replied Anderson, scarcely above a whisper.  Drops
of sweat glistened on his face.
</p>

<p>
"A long time,&mdash;yes, I know," murmured Hemming.
</p>

<p>
Presently he said: "Dick, you have not answered
my question."
</p>

<p>
Anderson cleared his throat, fingered his
moustache, and glanced about uneasily.  But he made
no reply.
</p>

<p>
"You don't think I have any chance?  You think
she does not care for me?" questioned Hemming,
desperately.
</p>

<p>
He reached over and gripped his friend's wrist
with painful vim.  "Tell me the truth, Dick, and
never mind my feelings," he cried.
</p>

<p>
Anderson withdrew his arm with a jerk.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you see?  Are you such a damn fool!"
he muttered.  "You come along, after you have
had your fun, and expect me to produce the joyous
bride,&mdash;the blushing first-love."
</p>

<p>
"What the devil is the matter with you?" asked
Hemming, aghast.
</p>

<p>
"So you imagine the world stands still for
you,&mdash;Mr. Commander-in-Chief?  You had better
hurry back to your nigger troops, or they'll be
having another revolution."
</p>

<p>
Hemming looked and listened, and could believe
neither his eyes nor his ears.  Was this the same
man who, once upon a time, had been his jolly,
kindly friend?  The once honest face now looked
violent and mean.  The once honest voice rang like
a jealous hag's.  Hemming stared, and stared, in
pained astonishment.  Then, by some flutter of his
companion's eyelids, understanding came to him.
</p>

<p>
"Dick," he said, "Dick, I am sorry."
</p>

<p>
By this time Anderson looked thoroughly ashamed
of himself.  "For God's sake, Bert, get out and
leave me alone," he cried, huskily.  "I've been
drinking too much, you know."
</p>

<p>
Without another word, Hemming paid his bill
and left the place.  Beyond the fact that Anderson
was in love with Molly, he did not know what to
make of that honest soldier's behaviour.  Perhaps
Molly loved Anderson, and Anderson was too loyal
to his old friend to further his own suit?  That
would make the mildest man act like a drunken
collier.
</p>

<p>
Hemming had been striding along at a brisk
pace, but, when this idea got hold of him, he turned
in his tracks and went back to the Trocadero, eager
to tell his friend to go ahead and win the happiness
in store for him.  But when he reached the place,
one of the waiters informed him that Major
Anderson had gone.  He immediately returned to the
club.  By this time, he had made up his mind to
write to Miss Travers, and say good-bye&mdash;for
ever.  On the club stationery he wrote:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"DEAR MOLLY:&mdash;My dreams have brought me
back to England, and almost to you.  But I met
Anderson a little while ago, and you will understand
why I do not call on you now.  It was foolish of me
to hope,&mdash;but I am afraid I have been a great many
kinds of a fool during my aimless life.  I intend
leaving town in a day or two, and returning to
one or other of my distant stamping-grounds.
Please think kindly of me, for 'old sake's sake.'  I
wish you all the happiness life and love can give.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As ever,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H.H."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He gave the letter to a page, to be immediately
posted, and then sat down in a deserted corner and
pretended to read.  His thoughts were in a turmoil,
and his heart ached dully.  It seemed to him that
fate was pressing him beyond human endurance.
His gloomy meditations were interrupted by a genial
voice addressing him by his Christian name, and,
looking up, he found Mr. Pollin at his elbow.
</p>

<p>
"You are prompt, my boy," remarked Mr. Pollin.
</p>

<p>
Hemming frowned.  What did the old ass mean
by saying he was prompt, he wondered.
</p>

<p>
"I got to town to-day," he replied, coldly.
</p>

<p>
Pollin pursed his lips and wrinkled his brow.
"Let me see,&mdash;ten, eleven, twelve,&mdash;why, that
is very quick work.  I mailed the note only twelve
days ago," he said.
</p>

<p>
"What note? and what are you talking about?"
asked his bewildered hearer.
</p>

<p>
"The note to you."
</p>

<p>
"I did not get any note."
</p>

<p>
"Then what the devil brought you here?"
</p>

<p>
"That is my own business, sir," retorted
Hemming, angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Easy, easy, Herbert," cried the old man.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, sir, for speaking to you like
that," replied Hemming, "but I am in a nasty
temper to-night, and I really can't make out what you
are driving at."
</p>

<p>
"Granted, my dear boy; granted with a heart
and a half," exclaimed Pollin.  "But tell me," he
asked, "do you mean to say that my note, advising
you to come to London, never reached you?"
</p>

<p>
"That is what I mean to say," Hemming assured
him.  Suddenly his face brightened, and he
leaned forward.  "Why did you advise me to come
to London?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pollin surveyed him critically.  "We'll just
sit down and have a drink," he said, "and then
maybe I will tell you."
</p>

<p>
Hemming's curiosity was sufficiently excited to
prompt him to comply with this suggestion.  He
wondered what old Pollin could have to say to
him, for they had never seen much of each other,
nor had they been particularly friendly.  But he
was Molly's uncle,&mdash;there lay the golden
possibility.  He smothered the thought.  More likely,
the communication would be something about
Anderson's prospects.  He smiled grimly, and
swallowed half his whiskey at a gulp.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pollin settled himself more comfortably in
his chair.  "I like your work," he began, "and
have always followed it carefully.  Your
Turko-Grecian book strikes me as a particularly fine
achievement.  What little of your fiction and verse
I manage to hunt out in the magazines appeals to
me in more ways than one.  It is good work.  But
even better than that, I like the good heart I see
behind it.  When, a few days ago, Mrs. Travers
asked me to protest with her daughter for refusing
eligible suitors, I felt it my duty to look into the
case,&mdash;hers and yours.  I did so, and came to the
conclusion that she still cares for you more than for
any one else.  That is my reason for writing you
to come home."
</p>

<p>
"Does she know that you have written to me?"
queried Hemming, his face and heart aglow.
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed, but I'm afraid she may suspect
when she sees you," replied Mr. Pollin, with some
show of uneasiness.
</p>

<p>
"And what about Anderson?" asked Hemming.
</p>

<p>
"Dick Anderson?  Ah, he is exceedingly stupid,
or he would have given up long ago.  He never had
the ghost of a chance," replied the beaming
match-maker.
</p>

<p>
Hemming stood up, and grasped the other warmly
by both hands.  "I got along without your letter,"
he said, "but I don't know what might have
happened by now if you'd not stumbled over me
to-night.  I saw Anderson, you know, and somehow
got the idea into my head that I was out of the
game."
</p>

<p>
"Out of the game," laughed Pollin.  "No fear
of that, my boy.  Come over to my diggings, and
we'll have a smoke on it."
</p>

<p>
As he led the prodigal from the club, clinging
affectionately to his arm, he warned him of
Mrs. Travers.  "Don't pay any attention to her,&mdash;unless
she happens to be polite," he said.
</p>

<p>
Late that night, after Hemming had returned
to his hotel, Mr. Pollin sat up and penned a note
to his niece.

CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
TO PART NO MORE
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "The eyes that wept for me, a night ago,<br>
  Are laughing now that we shall part no more."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was later than usual when Molly awoke that
morning.  It seemed to her that the room looked
brighter than it had for a long time.  The pictures
on the walls shone with a hitherto unnoticed glow.
She lay still for awhile, recalling the night's dream,
piecing the fragments one by one.  The dream
had been altogether pleasant and unusual.  She had
been in strange and delightful countries,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where below another sky<br>
  Parrot islands anchored lie."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
She had seen the palms shake their stiff foliage
against the steady winds.  She had gone along a
white street, gleaming between deep verandas, and
Hemming had walked beside her, talking of his
adventures and his hopes.  She had heard surf-music
drifting in from moonlit reefs, and the
tinkling of mandolins out of alleys of roses.  She had
gone through a land of sweet enchantment with
her lover's hand in hers.
</p>

<p>
Molly dressed slowly, the spell of her dreaming
still upon her, haunting her like a half-remembered
voice.  At the breakfast-table she found three
letters beside her plate.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to be a woman of affairs, my dear,"
said Mrs. Travers, eyeing the letters greedily from
her end of the table.  The dame had finished her
breakfast some time before, but, having examined
the three envelopes carefully, curiosity about their
contents kept her in her place.
</p>

<p>
When Molly saw Hemming's handwriting,&mdash;and
on the stationery of a London club at that,&mdash;she
leaned back, and for the flight of a dozen heart-beats
kept her eyes tight shut, and her hands clinched
on the arms of the chair.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, what is the matter?" cried her mother,
in tones of surprised concern.  She, too, had
recognized the writing, however.
</p>

<p>
"I felt dizzy&mdash;just for a moment," answered
Molly.  Then she opened the letter.  She read it
again and again, making nothing of it, save that
he was in London, had come there to see her, and
was going away again.  Love of her had brought
him, but why should he go away?  What had Major
Anderson to do with it?  Now her heart pulsed
joy through her veins, and now fear,&mdash;and they
both hurt.  Then came the fearful, humiliating
question,&mdash;could it be that her uncle had sent for
him?
</p>

<p>
"What has that shameless adventurer written
to you?" asked Mrs. Travers, purple with curiosity,
and with fear that the chances for her daughter
to marry a fortune were ruined.
</p>

<p>
"What shameless adventurer?" cried Molly,
looking up with flashing eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Herbert Hemming."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know the letter is from Herbert
Hemming?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I happened to notice the handwriting."
</p>

<p>
"Paul Pry," cried Molly; and with that she
burst into tears.  Mrs. Travers sailed from the
room, much against her inclination, but her dignity
demanded it of her.  Left to herself, Molly stifled
the sobs, brushed the tears from her eyes, and
opened the other letters.  Her uncle's she read with
wonder and delight.  It ran thus:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"DEAR NIECE:&mdash;Herbert is in town.  I ran
across him at the club.  He was in very low spirits,
suspecting something between you and Major
Anderson; but I soon cheered him up.  Now is my
time to confess that I wrote to H.H. a few days
ago.  Fortunately he had started for London before
receiving the letter (has not seen it yet), so there
is nothing for you to get angry at a doting uncle
about.  He tells me that never a scratch of a pen
has he received from you, since the beginning of
your misunderstanding.  He means to call on you
to-morrow, at the informal hour of ten in the
morning.  His happiness is all in your hands.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Your loving Uncle."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Anderson's communication,&mdash;a hopeless scrawl,
in which he said that Hemming was in town, and
that he himself was going to France for a little
while&mdash;only interested her in that it proved to be
a key to her lover's message.  Presently she glanced
up at the clock.  "Within half an hour," she cried,
softly, and, gathering together her papers, she left
the room.
</p>

<p>
Of course Hemming was twenty minutes ahead
of time.  Mr. Pollin might have known that, under
the circumstances, a lover always allows thirty
minutes for a ten-minute cab-drive.  Unfortunately,
Mr. Pollin, though an estimable man in a hundred
ways, did not know everything about a lover.  He
had very seldom been one himself, even of the
mildest type.  So when Hemming, short of breath,
glorious of visage, and flushing hot and cold,&mdash;in fact,
with all the worst symptoms of a recruit going
into action,&mdash;entered the long and formal
drawing-room, he was received by Mrs. Travers.  This
was a long way from what Pollin had led him to
expect.  He stood aghast; he got a grip on
himself, and, bowing low, extended his hand.
Mrs. Travers ignored his hand.  But, for all her
awe-inspiring front, she, too, was agitated.  She knew
that she was about to play a desperate game.  Fever
and rum had made the Brazilian colonel's game
seem feasible.  Conceit, stupidity, and love of
money were her excuse for making a fool of herself.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hemming, I believe," she said.
</p>

<p>
This was too colossal for Hemming.  He could
not pass that, however eager he might be to get
this unexpected interview over with.  He lifted
one hand close to his face and stared at it intently
for several seconds.
</p>

<p>
"'Pon my word," he said, "I believe you are
right.  May I ask if you recognized me by my
eyeglass or my feet?"  His smile was politely
inquiring.  He looked as if he really wanted to know.
</p>

<p>
"You will leave this house immediately," cried
the lady, as soon as she could command sufficient
breath.  "My daughter is very wise in deciding to
have nothing to do with you."
</p>

<p>
This shot told, and his manner changed to one
of haggard doubt and dread.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br>
&quot;AT THAT MOMENT MOLLY TRIPPED INTO THE ROOM&quot;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Travers saw her advantage, and, knowing
that her time was limited, hastened to follow it up.
But at that moment Molly tripped into the room.
At sound of the light step and whispering of skirts
Hemming turned toward the door.  The old woman
and all her works were forgotten, for Molly's eyes
proved the truth of his dreaming.  But he did not
approach her.  She paused on the threshold, not
speaking, not smiling, but with the whole dear secret
in her radiant face.  How long was it&mdash;seconds or
centuries&mdash;that her eyes looked into his across the
furniture of that formal room?  Presently, with a
little catch in her breath, like a sob, she spoke,
turning her gaze to Mrs. Travers.
</p>

<p>
"Mother," she said, "when I tell you that I overheard
your last remark, I think you will understand
and forgive the anger and&mdash;and disdain which I
feel toward you."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Travers, suddenly grown old and ugly,
moved toward the door.  She reeled, and nearly fell.
Hemming sprang forward, caught her firmly and
gently, and helped her to a couch.  By this time her
great face was dead-white, and her eyelids
fluttering.  He tore open the neck of her dress, and then
ran to the dining-room for water.  This he used
upon her with a liberal hand, and soon she gasped
and opened her eyes.  Molly put her arms around
her lover's neck.
</p>

<p>
"What a brute I am," she sobbed; "but&mdash;but
she called you a shameless adventurer&mdash;and
she&mdash;lied to you."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Travers completed her recovery as best she
could, without further assistance.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
A NEW COMMAND
</h3>

<p>
O'Rourke sent Mr. Pollin's letter back to Hemming,
and Molly treasured it, unopened, among her
dearest possessions.  Mr. Pollin had several serious
talks with his sister, but for all the good that came
of them he might have saved his breath to blow
smoke with.  That cantankerous, silly old lady,
firmly believing that her daughter had treated her
unkindly, refused to have anything more to do with
Hemming.  Before a few friends as biased or stupid
as herself she posed as a Christian martyr.  What
a pity there were no pagan emperors around, with
boiling oil and thumbscrews!
</p>

<p>
One morning, about three weeks after Hemming's
return, he and Molly rode together in Hyde Park.
Despite Mrs. Travers, and thanks to Mr. Pollin's
library and another friend's saddle-horses, they
managed to meet for several hours every day.  On
this occasion, as they walked their horses shoulder
to shoulder, they seemed deep in some great plan.
</p>

<p>
"I think good old Santosa has had his finger
in it," said Hemming.  "You see, he married the
daughter of the secretary of war not very long ago.
Rio is a beautiful place," he continued, "and a
general, even of the Brazilian army, is not a person to
be lightly treated.  Remember that, dear!"
</p>

<p>
"It will be simply glorious," cried Molly.  "But
are you quite sure that I have enough clothes, and
that there is no immediate danger of a revolution?"
</p>

<p>
"I should think one gown would be enough for
one wedding," he replied, smiling, "and as for a
revolution&mdash;bah!  Brazil is as safe as a nursery
these days."
</p>

<p>
"You must promise me not to give up your
writing," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I could not give it up if I tried.  I am under
contract for two novels inside the next two years,"
he answered.
</p>

<p>
Molly shook her head at that.  They touched their
nags to a canter, and for a little while rode in
silence.
</p>

<p>
"You took your time to find out," called Molly,
presently.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I can't make it any clearer to you,"
he replied.
</p>

<p>
Molly drew her horse toward his, and leaned
forward in the saddle.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest boy," she said, "I can't believe that
you will ever forget how cruel I was to you, though
I know that you forgave me long ago."
</p>

<p>
"The memory of it is buried somewhere in the
Pernamba bush, with the body of Penthouse," he
answered, gently.
</p>

<p>
"But tell me," she began, and paused.
</p>

<p>
"Anything," he laughed back.
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever care for Marion Tetson?"
</p>

<p>
"Not even in those days&mdash;when she was really
charming."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Several months later, at the house of a mutual
friend, Mrs. Travers met General Davidson.  The
general beamed upon her with marked cordiality.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad to know that some English people
appreciate a good thing," he said.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the company turned to see what was
going on, and the old lady stared.
</p>

<p>
"I am speaking of your distinguished son-in-law,
Herbert Hemming," continued the general, in a
dress-parade voice, "and I assure you, madam, that
when he took command of the military district of
Rio Janeiro, England lost a valuable man.  It is
a crying shame," he added, glaring around, "that
the English government had not Mrs. Travers's
discernment."
</p>

<p>
The dame mumbled a meaningless reply.  A curate
sniggered behind his hand.  Later Mrs. Travers
cornered her hostess.
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't the ungrateful girl tell me?" she
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Tell you what, my dear?"
</p>

<p>
"About that Rio Janeiro military district."
</p>

<p>
"You should have read the papers, my dear," replied
her hostess, coldly; "then, perhaps, you would
not have made yourself so ridiculous."
</p>
